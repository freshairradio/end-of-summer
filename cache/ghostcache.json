      "title": "Isaiah Rashad - Why Worry Single Review",
      "html": "<p>After four years following the success of <em>The Sun’s Tirade </em>in 2016, the Tennessee rapper Isaiah Rashad finally releases a new single under the Top Dawg Entertainment Label, ‘Why Worry’.</p><p>The title already teases his fans who have been impatient with his distance from the spotlight ever since <em>The Sun’s Tirade </em>exploded on streaming services preaching about topical themes of self-discovery and awareness in the black community. Fans were starved, and since last year’s tease of his upcoming album <em>The House is Burning</em> in collaboration with Kenny Beats, this new track came as a beacon of light in these trying times.</p><p>‘Why Worry’ produced by Crooklin, is reminiscent of his first studio album <em>Cilvia Demo (2014)</em>. Carefree Rashad hits the track with his signature voice and a playful attitude that was missing from his more profound reflections in <em>The Sun’s Tirade. </em> Although it will not be released on his upcoming record, it reveals the new-found calm and livelihood of the rapper, a promising sign for his new works. The lyrics evoke an independence and awareness of those trying to spite him “with false advices”. Crooklin’s sampling of soul vocals and the treble horns perfectly support Rashad’s new focus and mentality. In the chorus, Rashad is beckoning his fans to follow in his footsteps, “follow me” he repeats, and leave behind the obsession with “all that money on your head” – just live in the moment and search for the funk.</p><p>This single is the perfect teaser to his upcoming album, serving to reassure his fans but also to send a message of relief and lightheartedness in the hip-hop community, joyously disregarding all those who have tried to abuse and manipulate money or art.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kGeWK9hce1o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>",

      "title": "EOB - Earth Album Review",
      "html": "<p>Undoubtedly the most underrated Radiohead member, Ed O’Brien has been consistently framing the band with unique flavour and intrigue. His desire to draw every possible texture out of his guitar made him increasingly irreplaceable, from <em>OK Computer</em>’s masterful distortion to the experimental timbres he perfected on <em>Kid A </em>and beyond. Everyone was eager to see whether he could put his palette of guitar effects and conservative mixing to work without his more exciting band-mates, venturing beyond his specialist duties into this broader solo role.</p><p>The results are mixed.</p><p>The album is decidedly art-rock, yet EOB doesn’t hesitate to move beyond that. He dedicates much of the 45-minute runtime to passages of contemporary folk and ambient dance, as well as playing around with chorus vocals and a variety of percussion to fulfil the album’s world-music leaning. This keeps the project interesting and fresh throughout, although each component is not necessarily built to match, nor does EOB work particularly hard on making his fusions flow.</p><p>Though centred on inspirations from his time in Brazil and a renewed passion for the acid rave of Screamedelica, Ed is happy to mastermind contributions from varied collaborators. Producer Flood and mixing engineer Alan Moulder, who have worked on countless noteworthy albums together in the alt-rock arena, push a variety of sounds to the fore, adding to the already busy structure.  Flood’s keen sense of atmosphere undoubtedly complements the ambient passages in ‘Brasil’, ‘Mass’, and ‘Sail On’, whilst Moulder’s shoegaze experiences make themselves heard in the raw bass line on ‘Shangri-La’ and the gorgeously distorted drones in ‘Mass’. Bringing on the instrumental talents of Omar Hakim on the two 8-minute voyages ‘Brasil’ and ‘Olympik’ has also done EOB favours, especially on the latter, which offers a stellar drum pattern responsible for <em>Earth’s </em>most vibrant and energetic moments. Less inspiring are the guitar additions from David Okumu of The Invisible which represents an odd recycling of the 00’s alt-rock sound Radiohead is known for pioneering.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7Djc5z-EMg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>Indeed the album repeatedly suffers from such regression. Despite deciding against having Thom Yorke to sing on the record Ed often falls into distracting Yorkisms, mostly when he gets too comfortable in uplifting rock opener ‘Shangri-La’ or the pretentious and ineffective ‘Banksters’. His vocal performance is varied, mostly following a split trend of good backing harmonies but bad frontman work which detracts from the album’s elusive flow, most obvious on the dreary and repetitive ‘Deep Days’.</p><p>However, it is clear that Ed’s ability to work and rework sound has not depleted: every beat, riff, or drone is molded to perfectly sit alongside its companions, complementing this approach with Flood’s keen ear for what a song “is” to make ‘Earth’ the best possible version of itself. Unfortunately, no amount of productive genius can hide the flawed songwriting.</p><p>Although the independent halves of Brasil - a lovesick folk ballad and an ambient dance workout - are coherently moody, the stitching of their jarring styles relies on the production as a crutch. The disappointing ‘Deep Days’ fades meaninglessly away before more delightful folk balladry with ‘Long Time Coming’. This exhibits a rare bout of technical prominence from Ed, but is rather uninspiring in structure and emotion, and the well-crafted finger picking only succeeds in annoying mental comparisons to Nick Drake. Then comes the luscious sound of ‘Mass’, which uses the folk-meets-ambience fusion far more effectively, and minimal vocals lets the soundscapes take over. While ‘Banksters’ attempts to muster some energy into the album, it sounds like a <em>Hail to the Thief</em> B-side, and not one with much originality, composure, or anything like the political scorn it tries to bring with the central mantra ‘Where did all the money go, you f***?’. Although it might help him to get a spot on the playlists of Radiohead fans, it sits apart as the only straightforward alt-rock in the tracklist.</p><p>‘Sail On’ takes on a gently flowing feel, with Ed offering some soft melancholy vocals over ambient synths displaying yet more excellent production. It serves as a solid filler before the expansive ‘Olympik’, a song which offers a busy alt-dance crescendo, with plenty of musical breaks that allow turn-taking between the rolling rhythm and edged guitar flexes. A combination of Bono-esque vocals and the propulsive synths is nothing but Achtung Baby!-era U2, however through that 90’s prog-rock sound EOB exhibits the instrumental space of Krautrock and lets Hakim’s jazzy percussive style loose. The song is far more fulfilling that any other on the album, and would have made a good closer. Instead, EOB rounds off with ‘Cloak of the Night’, a final Pink Moon throwback, with the lusciously lethargic vocals of Laura Marling to spare us from an otherwise sleepy and ill-fitting closer.</p><p>For me, all this album offers is an affirmation of Ed O’Brien’s role within Radiohead. His ability to work a group of relatively weak songs into a record which, credit where credit is due, <em>sounds </em>fantastic, helps one understand the work he does in making Yorke’s bittersweet angst or Johnny Greenwood’s sporadic virtuosity function under a single moniker. Despite this underwhelming conclusion, there’s a ray of hope. EOB’s songwriting capacity and vocal style can only improve, and his capable control of his instruments is as clear as ever, he simply needs to expand on the creativity he hinted at on<em> Earth.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xefWbfWUbrQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>",

      "title": "Fiona Apple - Fetch The Bolt Cutters Album Review",
      "html": "<p>On April 17th, Fiona Apple dropped the perfect quarantine gift for us all: her first album since her 2012 release. <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</em> is filled with rage; it’s uncompromising, free and seamlessly moves through topics spanning from abusive relationships in <em>‘For Her’</em> and <em>‘Newspaper’</em> to high school experiences in <em>‘Shameika’</em>. This release illustrates Apple being able to truly make the music she has wanted to make for a long time, eschewing any kind of expectations previously placed on her, stating in the title track that<em> “I grew up in the shoes they told me I could fill / Shoes that were not made for running up that hill / And I need to run up that hill, I need to run up that hill / I will, I will, I will, I will, I will”.</em></p><p>Being relatively unfamiliar with the rest of her discography, I came into this album with no existing expectations except the numerous tweets praising it and texts from friends imploring me to listen. So, upon finally listening I was completely lost for words at just how original this record felt. It’s a masterclass in how to use anger constructively. Apple has taken her rage in a controlled and confident manner and woven it into the fabric of <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters </em>in such a way that none of it is lost. This is by no means and end product of her anger, but a place to illustrate that it is not going to stop her creating. In <em>‘Under the Table’</em>, she reiterates <em>“Kick me under the table all you want / I won’t shut up, I won’t shut up”</em>. This becomes a kind of manifesto for the entire record, Apple herself stating in an interview, <em>“Fetch the f****** bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation that you’re in — whatever it is that you don’t like”.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N541HLPeG6Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>It is how Apple moves through different topics with such ease, navigating different sources of anger, which make the album so significant. <em>‘For Her’</em> eloquently explores the impact sexual assault has had on many women, including herself. Whilst the majority of the lyrics achieve their impact through word play and poetic license, Apple explicitly illustrates the issues at hand, with the lyric <em>“You raped me in the same bed your daughter was born in”</em> inserted into the final verse. She stated that her <em>“hope is that maybe some women and men will be able to sing along with that line and allow it to tell the truth for them”</em>. The next song on the record, titled <em>‘Drumset’</em>, is composed from a voice message Apple sent to her bandmates after they took the drum kit to play another gig, stating that <em>“nothing changed in the lyrics from what I sang into the phone, which is why the lyrics are not very poetic”</em>. It is the immediacy and comic-nature of Apple belting out <em>“The drumset is gone / And the rug it was on / Is still there screaming at me”</em>, which adds to the overall tone of the album. It is honest and the pettiness (in Apple’s own words) of a handful of the lyrics only succeed in making the album more genuine. It has achieved its aim of telling the truth; it’s at times brutally honest and Apple’s raw, often unrefined vocals highlight this. The production is flawless and the decision to include the singer’s laughter from her dog licking her face and her exclamation of <em>“ah, f***, s***”</em> in the middle as she messes up a song, allow for a wholly authentic record.</p><p>Despite its dark subject matter, <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters </em>is an uplifting record, ending in <em>‘On I Go’</em>, which repeats the lines <em>“On I go, not toward or away / Up until now it was day, next day / Up until now it’s a rush to prove / But now I only move to move”</em>. Fiona Apple implores us all to do the same, to move onwards, to stay angry and to live without the weight of expectations. Demanding numerous listens, <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters </em>is a significant record in these uncertain times and will be for many years to come.</p>",

      "title": "Laura Marling - Song For Our Daughter Album Review",
      "html": "<p>Laura Marling’s 10-track navigation through nostalgia and womanhood is an ode to all our daughters. A landscape of the heart, Marling’s narrative is both personal and observant, private yet universal. Released ahead of schedule due to our collective confinement, ‘<em>Song For Our Daughter</em>’ is everything we didn’t know we needed.</p><p>It’s easy to make many comparisons between Marling’s seventh-studio offering, notably the Cohen inspired: ‘<em>Alexander</em>’ and the Joni Mitchell infused open tunings and explorative range, yet Marling deserves nothing less than complete ownership: ‘<em>it’s my right to wander’</em>, <em>Hope We Meet Again</em>, and rightly so, wandering to the extent that the album is uniquely hers. Production (Ethan Johns) is not decorative but loyally soars with cautiously placed strings and lavish percussion when warranted, complementing the grit and vulnerability of Marling’s speak-singing and accompaniments.</p><p>Such vulnerability is captured perfectly on lead single: <em>Held Down</em>, in which we explore the complexities of who we are in terms of another. From the power encapsulated in positional dynamics to the emotional standards that must be upheld: <em>‘I don’t want to let you down’, Held Down</em>does not paint an image of helplessness but one of delicate simplicity, and such is the key distinction from Marling’s previous albums. Whilst on the surface thematically similar to <em>Semper Femina</em>, Song For Our Daughter’s greatest strength is its universality, conveyed through the scarce, or obvious, use of metaphors and mutual relatability.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZU0t2Y6ACz8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>Such simplicity runs effectively throughout the album, notably in: <em>Blow By Blow</em>. A meticulously placed middle track, the piano-backed ballad whispers heartache through its tenderly placed strings and harmonies, the latter moving as a chorus of women harmonising in solidarity and commonality with the protagonist, Marling herself.  Such imagery lends itself to the success of Marling’s commentary on womanhood and persisting conventions of femininity.</p><p>The punchy, self-reflective: <em>Strange Girl</em> acts as a percussive rallying call to finding oneself in the new-found wake of narcissists and unpaid experience, whilst the title track: <em>Song For Our Daughter </em>succeeds in conveying, with utter sincerity, a universal hope for those which come after us, in that they can be better prepared and equipped: <em>‘The book I left by your bed’ </em>to deal with what many have been and/or continue to be subject too: <em>‘The words that some survivor read.’ </em>The title track also plays as a commentary on navigating the music industry as a woman, and such lends itself in relatability to other aspects of professional life. If our clothes haven’t been commented on first before our music, we feel naked even with them on, our souls laid bare under intensified scrutiny and isolation, very much in the minority in the studio, stage and writing room. The minimalist arrangement of strummed guitar and sparse piano creates space for articulation, valuing the freedom to hear one’s own voice.</p><p>From financial independence to emotional autonomy, freedom is further explored two-fold. The album’s arguably most harrowing track: <em>Fortune, </em>inspired by Marling watching her own Mother save up £1 coins, depicts the lifeline offered to a woman through her financial independence:</p><p>‘<em>You took out that money that your Momma had saved, she told me she’d kept it for running away</em>.’</p><p>Thus painting universal imagery all too synonymous with the sensibility of having an escape route to call upon if needed, whilst the longing for emotional autonomy in: <em>The End Of The Affair</em>, narrates experiences of empathetic endings implicit of mothering as we consume the feelings of another: ‘<em>This is too much for man to hope</em>’. It concludes with a prioritisation of the self: ‘<em>now let me live my life’</em>, once again moved to such a conclusion through a harmonising chorus of feminine commonality.</p><p>The lullaby-like: <em>For You</em> futuristically rocks us to the end with a bass-led harmonic descension, concluding the body of work with a relevancy as poignant as any of the great works of feminist commentary. In a time defined by nostalgia and collective trauma, Marling offers melancholy hope rich in experience, recovery and self-acceptance with a faithful collection of songs for all our daughters.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7RzBrwRLX2E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>",

      "html": "<p>In this special performance, the show begins with a series of shorts by the Lyceum Youth Theatre's Curtain Raisers. It was delightful to see waving parents in the audience - even if I was unsure if I was at the wrong show. Making the most of the current zeitgeist, there were posters reading “Tories Out”, a short on selfie-taking influencers, and the cult of positivity. Very on brand.</p><p>The performance is a mixture of highs and lows. The music is great, but I couldn’t make out all the words (which is saying something amongst the rest of the silver-topped audience). Despite great acting, there is no real plot. And the moments of great comedy are followed by weird and extended period of fourth-wall-breaking. You get my drift…</p><p>Mrs Puntila, played by the wonderful Elaine C. Smith, is a non-tax-paying, land-owning one-percenter. When drunk, she gives away life-changing opportunities left, right and centre, always with a sip of somethin’ to seal the deal. When sober, she’s suspicious, violent, and grumpy, rescinding on the job opportunities offered to those who have travelled for miles to get to her estate. The ratio between her drunken and sober states is a bit skew, such that it was difficult to tell at some points which one Mrs Puntila was in. Her long-suffering chaperone Matti, played by Steven McNicoll, offers bouts of welcome comic relief and really shines.</p><p>Then it gets a bit confusing again, not because the worthiness of the topic between the lines (capitalism, fair-pay, job opportunities, the realities and suffering of the working class), but because of the delivery. It cuts between some very on-the-nose-ness (like an extended fourth-wall break discussing tales of struggle in various political resistance movements), to a bold rendition of <em>Bella Ciao. </em>All without really tying the plot - something to do with Mrs Puntila’s daughter getting married - into any of it. Sure, it’s adapted from Brecht’s original by Denise Mina, but for some reason the coherence of plot doesn’t quite translate.</p><p>The exquisite serenade of <em>Loch Lomond </em>stands out. The cast crash through an ostentatious banqueting display, leaving Mrs Puntila gazing out at her Argyll estate to remark: “tell me that it breaks your heart to look at our land, Matti”.</p><p>Matti poignantly replies, “it breaks my heart to look at your land, Mrs Puntila”.</p><p><em>Mrs Puntila and Her Man Matti runs at the Lyceum Theatre until 21 March 2020.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>Everything’s coming up roses for Diana Massingberd.</p><p>An unexpected inheritance of £300 - £36,000, on the Edwardian exchange rate – lets Diana ditch the drudgery of Dobson’s Drapery Emporium. Eve Simpson’s live score narrates her pursuit of ‘new sensations’ - from ‘Bread and Roses’ in Clapham, to ‘La Vie En Rose’ in Switzerland. Blushing hues warm the stage. Diana dons a flowery number with matching waistband. Even the flower vase is printed with roses.</p><p>Directors Simpson and Elsie Greenwood set out to prove that, beyond their daily bread, working people deserve the roses of opportunities and aspiration. They haven’t overworked the message. Poppy Goad blooms as the complex, grounded Diana. Refusing to save her money, she is not impulsive, rather conscious that her funds – and freedom – are finite. Her principles remain steadfast. She despairs the ornamental class’ blasé attitudes towards soups, glaciers, and economics. She cannot buy into their rapacious tendencies, or wed for the sake of continued financial prosperity. Her ‘crowded hour of glorious life’ is just that, and Goad only stretches her arms – like a Massing<em>bird </em>– whilst she can.</p><p>Cicely Hamilton’s 1908 play is remarkably nuanced and relevant in its shadings of gender and class. Stereotypical material desires (shoes!) are dwarfed by Diana's grander desires to travel, or sack her oppressive boss. Male condescension is cleverly problematised. Joshua Garrett’s Jabez is peacocked in both economic obliviousness and hairstyling, whilst a pinched-cheek Charlie O’Brien embarks upon faux-Orwellian tramping. Yet, <em>Diana</em>'s women are near equally complicit within the oppressive patriarchy. Ruby Loftus’ Cantelupe is aggressively avaricious, ‘advising’ her hysterical nephew between mistrust and marriage proposals. Like Diana, Goad is nevertheless the ensemble's strongest character.</p><p>Subtle visuals accompany the recurrent rose motif. George Manchester and Savannah Sullivan set a pink-panelled platform in the round, reflective of the cyclical narrative and sociopolitical context, and perhaps Diana’s own persistent values. In a flurry of monochromatic skirts, corsets and chatter, the shopgirls circulate in transition between the plainness of the first act, to a tap dance in a Parisian café. </p><p>Perhaps Bedlam needs this altogether different stage, to platform Simpson and Greenwood's refreshingly ambitious and considered production. </p><p><em>Diana of Dobson’s runs at the Bedlam Theatre until 14 March 2020.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p></p><p><strong><em>MEGAN, ON THE CAST</em></strong></p><p>James McAvoy has stamina in Jamie Lloyd’s tenacious, lively and vibrant rendition of <em>Cyrano De Bergerac. </em>After first seeing it - albeit with an obstructed view - at the Playhouse Theatre in London, I was lucky enough to see it for a second time in Edinburgh, at the National Theatre Live screening at the Festival Theatre.</p><p>I was even more entranced upon a second viewing. Taking centre stage, McAvoy offers an angry yet emotional rendition of the famed 17<sup>th</sup> century poet. Undoubtedly too attractive for the role, McAvoy’s use of pace is almost faultless. But it is the flourishing moments of sensitivity which really steal the show. We empathise with Cyrano, we despair of Cyrano and we fall in love with Cyrano, all in the space of three hours. Indeed, his is not the sole memorable performance. Anita-Joy Uwajeh holds her own as Roxane, matching McAvoy’s pace and even reaching higher. Her performance is funny and relatable, bringing the audience on side. By the end of the production, it is her we are rooting for.</p><p>Supported by an exceptionally talented ensemble cast, the play is fresh and exciting. Rather than the 17<sup>th</sup> century verse of the original rendition, Martin Crimp’s script is modern and accessible: a delight for current audiences. Prior to this production, spoken word was not something I would have bought into, but this production of <em>Cyrano De Bergerac </em>has successfully persuaded me of its wealth of virtues.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>JELENA, ON THE STAGING</em></strong></p><p>Reviving Rostand’s nineteenth-century romance with streetwear and slam poetry skirmishes, director Jamie Lloyd might be (wrongly) accused of a shallow bid at wokeness. Clichéd beatbox aside, Lloyd’s stylistic choices rather amplify the words of Martin Crimp’s thrilling new adaptation.</p><p>Without the traditional seventeenth-century staging and costume, our attention focusses on the poetry and delivery. James McAvoy doesn’t need to sport a false appendage – endless teasing suffices to suggest of his enlarged (Cyra)nose. Soutra Gilmore’s sets are equally sparse, hardly containing McAvoy’s mighty renditions. Duelling in verse (versus Valvert), he transforms his microphone cord into a skipping rope, a whip, a soundwave reverberating between the pine box walls. At other times, dark settings and the use of a singular mirror reflect Cyrano’s own introspective nature, vulnerable and self-conscious. And no more than four plastic chairs situate Cyrano-Christian-Roxane’s hilarious blind date, De Guiche’s (Tom Edden) indecent proposals, and McAvoy’s sensual address.</p><p>Much is said without physical interaction. Though they remain quite separate, we know that Cyrano has grabbed Roxane (Anita-Joy Uwajeh) by her whimpering plea. The finale is suitably climatic, without the need for McAvoy to swoon, or lay outstretched. When Cyrano demands isolation in order to create, the large ensemble turn their backs in unison; he is left in their overwhelming company, and yet utterly alone.</p><p>With microphone stands and minimal staging, Jamie Lloyd’s <em>Cyrano de Bergerac </em>swaps panache for pure poetry.</p><p><em>Cyrano de Bergerac was <em>screened at the Festival Theatre on </em>9<em> </em>Februa<em>ry 2020.</em></em></p><p><strong>REVIEW BY MEGAN KENYON AND JELENA SOFRONIJEVIC</strong>.</p>",

The atmosphere was warmer, energetic. <em>Wholesome.</em></p><p>Celebrating Women’s History Month 2020, EUTC and the Edinburgh Revue’s joint <em>A Completely Normal Comedy Night</em> was absolutely and categorically a blast. Featuring only women and non-binary performers, (Ashley Manning as MC), the night really felt like a special celebration of upcoming talent, and there were many younger performers who were excellent. It was so exciting to be in the midst of such great talent and creativity. And it was hilarious too.</p><p>The first half was stronger, which may have been due to the show starting slightly later than scheduled, though there was a good pace throughout and the skits and shorts that broke up individual performances were a fantastic segue between acts.</p><p>True to the show’s description: “no gimmicks, no tokenism, and no boy comedians”, it was not lost on the audience that sadly it would be rare to see so many fantastic women and non-binary performers making up the majority (and in this case, all) of the line up, but what was also refreshing was the sheer variety of comedic range on stage. There was everything from a rap, an out-loud (and slightly disturbing, but in a funny way) musing about biting the heart of patient on a surgeon’s table (you really had to be there), to a wonderfully awkward re-purposing of the mic-stand to showcase some pole dancing skills.</p><p>The show’s headliner Amy Matthews was well worth the wait - genuinely hilarious and original with lots of great observational comedy. In Amy’s words, there is so much awesome talent around, we’d better get on supporting more shows.</p><p>I left grinning from ear to ear, and it was all for a good cause too!</p><p><em>A Completely Normal Comedy Night performed at the Bedlam Theatre on 6 March 2020.</em></p>",

      "title": "Big Thief",
      "html": "<p>4*</p><p>On Monday night, I arrived early to the Old Fruitmarket in Glasgow and watched as the crowed trickled into the venue. Quickly, I went from standing alone in a mostly empty room to being swallowed by a crowd and pinned awkwardly between two groups of friends and one young couple. The room swelled as the sold-out venue waited for Big Thief to take the stage.</p><p>As a band, Big Thief toes the line between alternative, indie, folk and country. Solid, strong guitar tones evoke a true country twang, while lead guitar lines keep it interesting, modern and alternative. From the very start the band was in true form. Adrianne Lenker showed an incredible and artistic vocal range, while also crushing it on guitar. Buck Meek (guitar), Max Oleartchik (bass) and James Krivchenia (drums) left nothing to be desired. The chemistry of the band, as well as each member's talent, created a beautiful symphony of sound. At points it seemed impossible that all the different tones could be coming from only four instruments.</p><p>Big Thief released two albums in 2019, <em>U.F.O.F</em> in May and <em>Two Hands</em> in October. Yet, throughout the set, the band played not one, but three brand new tracks. It was clear that the poetry that drives Big Thief's lyrics pours out of Lenker. Their story of writing 'Not' in Scotland, on a travel guitar in the bathroom of a house in the country side, painted an even bigger picture of the pure talent and raw emotion the seems to flow unimpeded into Big Thief's music.</p><p>With an extensive catalogue, Big Thief could have comfortably filly the show without ever going back to their most famous, older tracks. Instead, they did the complete opposite. Not only did they play many of their most famous songs, including 'Shark Smile' and 'Masterpiece', but they rejuvenated them in a way that inspired fun. The band was having fun, the crowd was having fun. I have been to shows where the band drags through their most famous songs because they see it as an obligation. Big Thief turned this idea on its head and we all got to party together to the tracks that everyone loves. The stand out song of the night was 'Mythological Beauty'. It was the song we all know and love, but made even bolder, louder and more energetic.</p><p>After well over an hour of music, the band left the stage. When they returned for one final encore track, it lacked energy and created a mildly confusing finished to the night. Then the lights came back up, it was suddenly all over and the packed room was filing out the doors and onto the street. </p>",

      "html": "<p>There are a great many themes considered in Bedlam’s adaptation of Luke Norris’ book <em>So Here We Are. </em>Outwardly, the characters (of questionable names), Smudge, Pugh, Pidge are bullish and boisterous, beer in hand and bantering between each other (until one invariably takes it too far and there’s a stand-off moment). Dan sits almost out of the view of the audience, looking pensive.</p><p>The opening scene is, sadly, frustrating. The composition of characters and set design works extremely well visually, and yet the long pauses and sighs from the characters (meant to denote boredom and long-waiting about something we were yet to find out), drag on too long. At one point, I wondered if the play would ever start.</p><p>The scenes that follow are more cohesive and fluent, and the real strength comes from the moments on stage shared by the boys in pairs. Though a little exaggerated (if cringy) in their 'Essex-boy' swaggers, the cast are generally strong. Smudge's sharing a long-held secret with Dan is sweetly done, and a really touching moment. Equally, Smudge’s demeanour as the seemingly half-witted member of the gang is also well translated and believable. Other moments too, such as the five black balloons on stage, the cheers-ing to Frankie’s memory, and the suggestion that they couldn’t play five-aside again also stand out, as the characters seek to deal with the terrible loss of a friend.</p><p>The whispers and gossip around whether or not Frankie’s death is an accident or suicide are also brought to attention. Kirsty (Frankie’s girlfriend) is visibly bereaved and angry, struggling to deal with the overwhelming emotions that come with death. Here, the audience gets an insight into all the character’s modes of coping, from a quiet pain (as Dan), to Pugh and Pidge, refusing to give in to vulnerability.</p><p>There are some moments of exaggeration, and the performances are sometimes overdone. Nevertheless, those touching confessional moments on stage linger with me the next day.</p><p><em>So Here We Are runs at the Bedlam Theatre until 5 March 2020.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>The Forest of Arden came to life at the Pleasance Theatre last night as members of Edinburgh University Shakespeare Company (EUSC) took to the stage to perform <em>As You Like it</em>. One of Shakespeare’s brilliant comedies, the play has it all: wrestling, absurdity and plenty of romance.</p><p>Following the banishment of her father, Rosalind (Tilly Botsford) flees to the forest with her cousin Cecilia (Lizzie Lewis) and fool, Touchstone (Will Peppercorn). Once there, chaos ensues and romance blossoms, in true Shakespearean fashion.</p><p>Directed by Michael Zwiauer, the EUSC’s <em>As You Like It</em> is set at the turn of the twentieth century, with beautiful costumes expertly designed by Laura Hounsell. From gorgeous straw boaters adorned with garlands of flowers to Touchstone’s characteristically flamboyant blazer, the show’s overall aesthetic was reminiscent of an Edwardian garden party. The costumes were complemented by the subtle, yet successful set which was completed by gorgeous green lighting. Zwiauer’s Forest of Arden is subtle without being rendered inconspicuous, although occasionally atmosphere did overcome action. That being said, the use of live music throughout the production gently mingled with the plot providing a greater sense of authenticity regarding the play’s pastoral ethos. Guitar in hand, Ally Shilson offered delicate vocals throughout accompanied by the elegant duo, Lucy Hicks-Beech and Jo Hill on piano and violin respectively.</p><p>Indeed, the production’s subtlety endures in the performance of its actors. There is a propensity when staging <em>As You Like It</em> or any of Shakespeare’s comedies to favour slapstick over finesse. This performance mostly ensures that it occupies the latter category. From the gloriously funny depiction of Duke Senior (Fergus Head) as a withering old gentleman with grey hair and a bad back to match, to Audrey’s (Hannah Churchill) wonderful west country accent, it was these small flourishes which brought the comedy to life.</p><p>Comedy aside, the production was full to the brim with exceptional and accessible performances. Michael Hajiantonis made for a superb Jaques. It would perhaps be easy to play up on the characteristic ‘melancholy’ of Duke Senior’s resident poet but Hajiantonis was quick to provide a fresh interpretation of the role. His rendition of ‘All the world’s a stage’ made refreshing use of pace and his tongue-in-cheek embodiment of the Shakespearean soft boy was a particular highlight. Lizzie Lewis as Cecilia offered a sensitive yet suitably witty counterpart to Tilly Botsford’s Rosalind. The delightful sisterhood between the two cousins was wonderfully convincing and a joy to watch.</p><p>Still, it was Botsford’s Rosalind who offered the finest performance of the evening. Her acting was equal parts energetic, uplifting and measured. The transition from Rosalind to Ganymede was free from its usual ridiculous over-the-top performativity but was rather endearing and relatable. This sense of accessibility came across most acutely in the epilogue. With lucid use of timing and expression, it was a fitting end to a marvellous production. At a moment with deadlines and exams are looming, the EUSC has offered a whirlwind of fun amidst the chaos of university life.</p><p><em>As You Like It runs at the Pleasance Theatre until 8 March 2020.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>Everybody's talking about Jamie, quite literally. The West End musical which has won several awards is now well on its way to conquer the rest of the UK and Amsterdam. Perhaps it is the fact that it is based on Firecracker's 2011 documentary following the real-life Jamie Campbell getting ready for his prom, or that Jamie himself, in full merchandised dress extravaganza, is welcoming the audience in the foyer. First impressions from the audience makes me looking forward to a heartwarming evening full of dance and drag, enjoyable by all generations. </p><p>The show kicks off with Jamie (played by Layton Williams) and his Year 11 class fantasising about their futures and dancing on tables. At first it is a welcome surprise to hear the Sheffield accents, but that soon turns into a helpless blur of specific words, phrases, jabs and jokes that I can make neither heads nor tails from. The actors frequently jump into each others sentences making it hard to follow who says what, and what they actually say. The jokes that I do manage to catch are absolutely hilarious though, and from the laughter in the audience I can tell many teenagers there can relate. The relationship between Jamie and his mother (Amy Ellen Richardson) is full of warmth and hope for the future, the same goes for Jamie's friendship with Pritti Pasha (Sharan Phull). The number of professional drag queens on stage is really a show in itself, and the advice and attention they give to Jamie must be secretly cherished by soon-to-be drag queens in the audience. </p><p>I wonder how the musical will be received in Amsterdam, and during future tours in Korea/Italy (2020) and China/Japan (2021). I'm not quite sure if it was the accents, the sound level differences, the singing in generally, or the local jibes - sadly, I only really followed about 40% of the story. During talking or singing there was quite some background noise, such as a desk or the buzzing of loud music, that was essentially at the same volume as the primary voice. The music was modern, so 2011 (I'm honestly not surprised if Layton Williams will release a single with Sam Smith fairly soon), however the use of manipulated samples instead of a real orchestra or band really flattened out the songs as they sounded tinny and fake. </p><p>Though I'm happy to have learned about the couragous story of Jamie Campbell, I feel this musical might have gone a bit too far in terms of creative licence. I hope for the next tour they can keep it real, keep it Jamie. And as he told me during interval: \"More dancing on tables, please!\"</p><p><em>Everybody's Talking about Jamie runs at the Festival Theatre until 7 March 2020. </em></p>",

      "html": "<p>So much of the experience of seeing a show is determined by your own state of being: how you are feeling or how your day has been. I spent yesterday running from task to task, until I was finally the last one through the doors at the Traverse Theatre. Stepping out of a cloud of stress, I found myself say in a dark room, the beautiful cacophony of string instruments reverberating in my ears, being forced to think about how precious life is.</p><p><em>We Are In Time </em>is an ensemble piece by the Scottish Ensemble and Untitled Projects in association with Perth Theatre. This show tells the reality of the process behind heart transplants. It follows the entire process, through its grief, its technicality, its time span, and its result. In this, medical information is conveyed through the intermingling of string instruments, harmonies, narration, and solos. This piece is both emotional and informative in its pursuit to display the realities of heart transplant procedures.</p><p>The performance is dominated by an ensemble cast. This cast consists of twelve string musicians, including violinists, violists, cellists, and bassists. The use of the string instruments is masterful. As each musician plays their own part, they come together to fill the room with wonderfully haunting tones. From complex pieces to playing on muted strings (making the sound of a heart beat), these instruments create the environment of the performance.</p><p>At points I found myself confused. With no medical knowledge, the layering of strings, harmonies, solos, and the TV footage that slid on tracks across the back wall of the stage was overwhelming. This resulted in parts of the information and sentiment being lost in the distraction. However, the pace of the performance meant that these moments of confusion never lasted long. With the change of song and clear narration, performed by Alison O'Donnell, even those of us who know nothing about medicine could keep up.</p><p>The performances of soloists Jodie Landau and Ruby Philogene add emotion into the clinical narration. Providing the prospective of the donor and the recipient, respectively, their operatic voices highlight the sadness and the anticipation, but most the human element of this medical procedure.</p><p>Over the span of an hour and a half, the audience is immersed in the hospital environment. The staging and costuming must be commended. Whilst minimalistic, it plays on the clean lines and muted tones that one expects form a hospital environment and medical scrubs. As an audience, in this atmosphere, we experience life and death, mourning and healing. This performance is beautiful, but it also informative and sobering.</p><p>Days often get away form us, caught up in the motions of life. At the end of a busy day, this performance made me think about life, the privilege of health, family, and my own heart beat. Lub-dum, lub-dum, lub-dum.</p><p><em>We Are In Time runs at the Traverse Theatre until 4 March 2020. </em></p>",

      "html": "<p>First performed in 1987, John Adams’ ‘CNN opera’ follows the President’s epochal visit to Beijing in February 1972. Adams describes his score as a mix of ‘Day-Glo colours and upbeat energy’, with jazz and rock ‘n’ roll elements representative of Nixon’s hopeful aspirations – both foreign and domestic.</p><p>The historical portrayals are sympathetic, and exaggerated for the operatic form. Eric Greene’s Nixon is ever-concerned with the eyes of history, the media, and the electorate; his jingoistic enthusiasm muffling Nicholas Lester’s Chou En-lai during their first encounter. Pat Nixon (Julia Sporsén) is a thoughtful, if naïve, figure, afforded great attention in the second act. David Stout’s Henry Kissinger is suitably lecherous, particularly during the later ballet scenes; his depiction so enduring, I winced even in the curtain call. The Chinese representations are more complex. Chairman Mao (Mark Le Brocq) is an ailing, introspective figure, simultaneously staking support for the Western right, and suspicion of America’s (capitalist, imperialist) intentions. And Hye-Youn Lee’s Chiang Ch’ing (Madame Mao) – who delivers the production’s strongest performance in her signature coloratura aria – is truly terrifying.</p><p>Orchestrated to the smallest precision, the production’s greatest successes outlie the main cast. Coordinating proceedings are the overwhelming chorus of backstage bureaucrats. As the Nixons pick canapes behind ever-flashing cameras and ever-scribbling secretaries, they scoop noodles from takeout boxes. Near hauntingly omnipresent, the centrality of the chorus suggests of the great number behind the landmark 1972 meeting. Chiang Ch’ing commands moving dance scenes in <em>The Red Detachment of Women</em>, one of the Eight Model Operas of the Cultural Revolution. The Scottish Opera Orchestra, led by Anthony Moffat, offer an (expectedly) impressive rendition. With so much to merit, it was often difficult to know where to focus attention.</p><p>Dick Bird’s design and staging deserves particular acclaim. Floor-to-ceiling brown boxes represent archives, upon which primary images, videos, and texts are projected. Actual footage of Nixon and Chou En-lai toasting shots shadows over their characters, their handwritten and speeches (respectively) scroll as they sing. The rotating platform and expanding box offer rich new settings, including Mao’s notebook-stuffed offices. Beyond these practical opportunities, the staging thus contributes to the ongoing process of historical memory-making.</p><p>Director John Fulljames’ few allusions to the present day were coarse and unnecessary. An unexpected Deliveroo driver, and a photographic series setting Nixon and Mao against Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon, only distract from self-evident import of this historic meeting. It is the deft combination of fictional performance and primary sources which make <em>Nixon in China 2020 </em>a landmark of historical myth.</p><p><em>Scottish Opera: Nixon in China 2020 runs at the Festival Theatre until 29 February 2020.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>Oscar Wilde’s classic farce indulges to a state of gluttony – aptly embodied by Fergus Head’s muffin-stuffed Moncrieff. Scarcely delivering a line without spitting a crumb, you wonder how Head can stomach the additional Saturday matinee.</p><p>Director Kirsten Millar opts for a faithful rendition of the original script. Wilde’s words alone are enough to tickle titters amongst the tightest-lipped of audiences, and the six-piece offer a deft delivery. Gordon Stackhouse is a convincing Jack, bouncing off Head’s enthusiasm – and the walls and furniture – with endless energy. In a moment of anger, Stackhouse snatches the afternoon tea set from Head so hard that he turns red. Indeed, Stackhouse and Head’s early interactions are wonderfully lively, detailing Jack’s ‘Ernest’ predicament, and Algernon Moncrieff’s (quickly shed) scepticism towards marriage.</p><p>Ishbel McLachlan’s shrill Lady Bracknell certainly owes more to Edith Evans than the more restrained Judi Dench. Despite her unrestrained volume, each line – whether her contempt towards Bunbury’s undecided state of health, or the infamous ‘handbag’ – is delivered with comic precision. No stranger to the role of comedic protagonist, McLachlan is perhaps the natural Bracknell. Her mere stage entrance often triggered laughter (and some snorting) amongst audience members. Aine Higgins’ Gwendolen Fairfax shares more with her mother than the same shade of lipstick and a penchant for chignons. Even her coyest suggestions are delivered with a glare so assertive to suggest mild sociopathy. Georgie Carey’s deluded diarist Cecily offers a welcome balance to the cast’s commanding glares.</p><p>Though true to the production’s Victorian setting, the orthodox staging and props would have profited from a little polish. Yet, this is easily overlooked – the audience’s eyes are plenty distracted darting between the energetic six-piece.</p><p>What’s in a name? It is no mean feat to tackle Wilde’s most playful piece. Nevertheless, there’s something about this puffed-up performance which inspires my absolute confidence.</p><p><em>The Importance of Being Earnest runs at the Bedlam Theatre until 29 February 2020.</em></p>",

      "title": "True History of the Kelly Gang Review",
      "html": "<p><em>True History of the Kelly Gang</em> interprets the life of Ned Kelly, an Australian outlaw of the 19th century. Beginning with his traumatic childhood and ending with his undoing, the film is set up as a letter from Ned Kelly to his unborn son, in which he swears to tell him only the truth about his father’s life. The truth proves itself to be the thematic centrepiece of the film—and an appropriate one, considering how the historical Kelly is lost in his own mythology.</p><p>The cinematography is breathtaking. Against the bleak, grey-and-white Australian landscape, the colourful frocks of the Kelly gang are bizarre and beautiful. There is also a punk element amid the 19th century setting: the costumes have a touch of Vivienne Westwood, the walls where the Kelly gang meet their end are scribbled over with graffiti, and of course, the overall attitude of the gang as they form is anarchic, seeking to free itself of the tyranny of colonial corruption.</p><p>Characters onscreen are a joy to watch. Ned Kelly himself was well-played by George McKay, who brought Kelly from hardened innocent to tragic madman. Essie Davis’ Ellen Kelly, the family’s ruthless matriarch, is first seen idealistically through young Ned’s eyes, but quickly emerges to be a complex, narcissistic and jarring character. Even the brief presence of Harry Power (Russell Crowe) is a powerful, memorable and oddly charming one.</p><p>Better than the characters were their relationships. Ned’s loyalty to his mother brings a disturbing relationship of love and manipulation. He may resent her, but he is willing to die for her; she is gleeful at the thought. As a child, Ned’s relationship with his father is ridden with guilt, while his bond with his mentor Harry Power goes from warm and affectionate to barbaric in moments. Later, the Kelly gang form the warmth and camaraderie missing from their early lives—they are physical, wrestling and teasing one another, and (iconically) stealing each other dresses.</p><p>The main point of weakness was Mary, Ned’s love interest and the mother of his child. She is flat and mild, with practically no character of her own. She begins as a prostitute who wins his affection, for no apparent reason; after she has served her central purpose in the plot, she’s basically off making croutes and holding her baby for the rest of the film. Ned’s sisters are, sadly, given a similar treatment, with even less screen time. It seems a wasted opportunity, particularly when the real Ned Kelly’s sisters seem to have been very much involved in his tempestuous life.</p><p><em>True History of the Kelly Gang<em> is in cinemas now.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Reviewed as Film of the Week, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CameoCinema/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAKPislawMGrxiIlOlKYIP0GVXzfAUHgmBMjXHmpalXq5DqZ0ekPOKWkVhdpl0anMOypoM_ffelobqg&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3m5rVwBfwOJBI9lTeXSVSV4IYSi-mkvNZrxLjX3sf9xQMBIfwQHqmnOVhTFYMde1OP-K_JXHjoyELZdbrRqQDXdlHV7H5DG6KX3FTQ1Fzhb3w-GoG7ijjb_l1NfYC7DJv3itREpuLqx53UleCbHFCPh1eylwt12_xPafkq3MvN_UySxZGvJea5I8ZySnFlrWmbaCut5-8BkE3Ga1Ro4DBM_S-mnuCuqcAOjZTcwpJqLTYt5CiI89TWL2qeKxQIcA6kU0MUg_evAWOWlP6z0X2xgsM-IjI0zCr9irfz-vyW5yJGaFEwKoHbNAOIRGXXX4EEs4yA24RniNW96daiVU\">Cameo Cinema</a>, Edinburgh</em></em></p>",

      "html": "<p>This documentary gives you no time to warm up. It begins with the full-on heavy breaks and drops of drum and bass music as cast and crew are introduced in a visually stimulating opening credits. For anyone with a personal history in drum and bass or the warehouse rave scene, you are instantly hit with a wave of nostalgic euphoria as the sounds and images of your youth pulsate throughout the theatre.</p><p><em>United Nation: Three Decades of Drum and Bass </em>adheres to a very conventional documentary structure. The documentary is vocalised through Terry ‘Turbo’ Stone, the founder and promoter of United Nations. There are interviews with a wide range of prolific drum and bass DJs and MCs, from Skibadee and Andy C to Sigma and DJ Fresh. All of whom, give passionate and interesting accounts and opinions of the development of the drum and bass scene from the late 80s to the present day, as well as the influence of United Nation on that scene.</p><p>The documentary is at its greatest when those interviewed are discussing the cultural and sociological implications of the music and the scene during the 80s and 90s. There are discussions on the breakdown of racial/cultural barriers, DJ Ray Keith calling the scene ‘the first time black and white people engaged on a real level’. We are also shown how the scene was a direct response and a necessary creation during a bleak political and economic climate. Or in the words of Jumping Jack Frost: ‘[it was the] middle of a recession, Maggie Thatcher, the country on its knees, people needed to dance, people needed to express themselves.’</p><p>As we go forward in time, we watch the evolution of the drum and bass scene. The turn from the ‘Summer of Love’ to thug culture, darker music and harder drugs. The introduction of the Criminal Justice Bill, the rise of the MC, and the need for tougher security. The documentary follows the music, the politics and the industry with impressive balance.</p><p>The film also follows the life of Terry Stone very closely. Often, we are taken away from focus on the music or the scene to instead focus on Stone’s personal life. To focus on his success, his married life and rise from flyerer to powerful promoter. At times the documentary appears to almost slip into a vanity project and lose touch with its discussion of the music. However, in due fairness, this is a documentary of United Nations, not just of drum and bass.</p><p>To be appreciated, the documentary requires an love for or interest in drum and bass and the rave scene, but to those that possess this, it is surely not to be missed.</p><p><em><em>United Nation: Three Decades of Drum and Bass<em><em> is in cinemas now</em></em>.

      "title": "I Think We Are Alone Review",
      "html": "<p><em>I Think We Are Alone</em> focuses on six characters, all at interlocking and overlapping moments in their lives. Two sisters, Clare and Ange, have not talked in eight years due to events that happened in their childhood. Josie, an overprotective mother, fails to come to terms with the death of her Father, focusing instead on what she thinks is best for her son Manny. Graham, a cab driver, mourns his wife and tries to fight the feeling of loneliness it brings. </p><p>Sally Abbot's writing is very accessible, and in equal parts humorous and meaningful, often reminding the audience that despite the subject matter of loneliness, death and loss, there is still humour in our everyday lives which should not be overlooked. Chizzy Akudolu (Josie) greatly contributes to the humour of the piece, skilfully balanced with moments of thoughtfulness and creating a figure we can all recognise our own mothers in. I did feel that the structure of monologue after monologue in places was somewhat overwhelming and tedious in places, so much so that when the dialogue scenes came, they felt like a breath of fresh air. Polly Frame (Clare) and Charlotte Bate (Ange) should be particularly commended on this point - despite spending almost the entire length of the play separate, their scenes together were electric. </p><p>A real highlight of this production is the set design (Morgan Large) and its stunning integration with lighting design (Paul Keogan). The core set consists of four large walls on wheels, each with a frosted perspex covering and LED lights in the base. These ‘walls’ are moved around the space to create a whole manner of different settings in a heartbeat, with the aid of Ella Wahlstrom’s often subtle but hugely effective sound design. The integration of these three elements are the real stand out factor; all contributions furthered the story telling and are never used without purpose or merely for aesthetics. </p><p>Going into this show and knowing the standard of work produced by Frantic Assembly, I had high expectations - which were met, but not exceeded. This is nonetheless, a different kind of show for Frantic Assembly, one which feels far more calm, thoughtful and reflective than some of their earlier work with its fast paced movement sequences. This is by no means a negative; the use of lifting and the Frantic style of physical theatre that we are used to are sparse, making it all the more effective when employed. The result is a piece which will likely resonate with many and one which is a testament to Frantic Assembly's ability to tell powerful stories with the simplest of means. </p><p><em>I Think We Are Alone runs at the King's Theatre until 22 February 2020.</em><br></p>",

      "html": "<p>I feel I need to preface this review by starting with the incontestable fact of its breathtaking beauty. Huge props to the costume and production designers – the house is a pastel cake, spotless, coloured in sugary greens and pinks and blues, and Anya Taylor-Joy (who plays the titular Emma herself) a white frilled, extraordinarily beautiful doll in these sets, positioning herself always to show her best angles with her blonde ringlets spinning when she does. The fields are bright green and the skies are bright blue and every room is an overladen visual delight of wealth and perfect social order. I did want the dresses; I did want the five-tiered desserts.</p><p>Aesthetics aside, sadly, not very much happens. In this two-hour long movie, perhaps as an overarching social commentary of the upper class of the time, the drama seems in a word: <em>silly.</em></p><p>In this beloved Austen tale, Emma, pampered and stuck in her rural town with her humorous hypochondriac father (played too well by Bill Nighy) as a big fish in a very small pond, decides to amuse herself by playing matchmaker to her new, wide-eyed orphan friend Harriet (Mia Goth) and creating interminable problems for everyone she knows in her arrogance. Meanwhile, she herself falls in love with the handsome outsider Frank Churchill, or is it the rather closer to home (and the also handsome) Mr Knightley? Ah, but Harriet loves him too! Can they ever be together?</p><p>My annoyance with this film – that did indeed have the potential to be charming and transporting – is its sugariness without content, and without even the good grace to be properly romantic.</p><p>Austen at her best is witty and cutting in her social observation of the minutiae of the English upper class of the Georgian period. This film, filled with strange pauses between woodenly delivered lines and pampered characters without a saving grace, leaves all of this behind to linger on the bon-bon coloured interiors.</p><p><em>Emma is in cinemas now.</em></p><p><em>Reviewed as Film of the Week, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CameoCinema/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAKPislawMGrxiIlOlKYIP0GVXzfAUHgmBMjXHmpalXq5DqZ0ekPOKWkVhdpl0anMOypoM_ffelobqg&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3m5rVwBfwOJBI9lTeXSVSV4IYSi-mkvNZrxLjX3sf9xQMBIfwQHqmnOVhTFYMde1OP-K_JXHjoyELZdbrRqQDXdlHV7H5DG6KX3FTQ1Fzhb3w-GoG7ijjb_l1NfYC7DJv3itREpuLqx53UleCbHFCPh1eylwt12_xPafkq3MvN_UySxZGvJea5I8ZySnFlrWmbaCut5-8BkE3Ga1Ro4DBM_S-mnuCuqcAOjZTcwpJqLTYt5CiI89TWL2qeKxQIcA6kU0MUg_evAWOWlP6z0X2xgsM-IjI0zCr9irfz-vyW5yJGaFEwKoHbNAOIRGXXX4EEs4yA24RniNW96daiVU\">Cameo Cinema</a>, Edinburgh.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>The <em>Pride Plays is </em>Scotland's first ever LGBTQI+ playwright festival. Returning to Edinburgh for a second year as part of LGBT History Month Scotland, they platform an underrepresented community within Scottish theatre.</p><p>The Traverse's showcase started with <em>We’ll Meet in Moscow,</em> written by Natalie McGrath and directed by Connel Burnett. We only see one character on stage - Dasha (Rebecca Elise) - for the full performance and it was something completely unexpected. Through her life in Russia, we see her finding love. The words were brought to life through the sheer power of love and a sense of anger. That anger is something which those in the queer community have to put up with, and it is something which was not overused or abused. The words were calling out to be spoken. A love which is most beautiful but dangerous for Dasha as being gay in Russia is still illegal. It is something which is political yet so natural. In the Q&amp;A session after the show was over, McGrath said that she wanted to partly write this story to show that it is okay to be gay. And wanted to write a love story that was real. It is something to keep an eye out for as it is something everyone should see. A moving, heart-breaking story which not only allows people to see what it is like to be gay in other countries, but the words and performance leave you feeling fulfilled yet wanting more. </p><p>The second performance was <em>Cocoon</em>. Written by Katie Gartian-Close and directed by Jo Rush, it follows a lesbian couple - Randy (Neshla Caplan) and Sophie (Nalini Chetty) - on a train journey from Vancouver to Seattle. With brilliant comedic moments and heartfelt scenes in equal measure it gives you an insight into what it is like to be a queer couple trying to make a family. Throughout the play we hear from a train announcer (Saskia Ashdown) who not only brings laughs and enjoyment from the more difficult scenes, but is used to bring the characters back to reality. It was a poignant piece which not only gave you the chance to imagine what it is like to try and have a baby, and all the emotions which come with it. It’s an all-round great performance with the actors bouncing off of once another and the writing cleverly done that you have to pay attention in order to get the full impact of the piece. If you hear about the play <em>Cocoon</em>, I urge you to go and see it. Not only will you hopefully find it enjoyable and witty, it gives you information about what the reality is for so many queer couples out their attempting to have a baby. </p><p><em>Pride Plays: 1 performed at the Traverse Theatre on 14 February 2020, as part of the Pride Plays Festival. </em><br></p>",

      "html": "<p>Ally Shilson's debut <em>Compartmentalisation 101 </em>takes flight into the uncomfortable parts of who we are, and how we successfully let our significant others see those uncomfortable pieces that bring us together. Like salted caramel, the sugary sweetness of a forever honeymooning couple mixes with the salty tang of the Bahamas waters, and all the prejudices that come with it. In leaving their London sanctuary for another (supposedly) heaven on earth, Cal has to come to terms with an estranged mother who found paradise wherever Cal was not, whereas Nat is confronted with a quite literal sense of feeling to be on the wrong side of the island.</p><p>Jumping between real-time and past conversations, Meg Wrigglesworth (Cal) and Khanyiso Mtwana (Nat) force each other, in a loving way, to face the hurt  – not shying away from calling out unacceptable behaviour. It is a lot; in little over an hour, the audience traverses emotional distress and reconciliation - all with a dreamy sand-in-my-toes tropical atmosphere, thanks to Technical Manager Nancy Strahan's chillwave-like lighting. </p><p>Though many of the topics raised came to the surface naturally, and realistically reflected actual situations,  some topics obscured others - inadvertently trivialising them. The death of a parent, an estranged parent, an estranged parent with mental health issues, (casual) racism, and ignored racial struggles, are all very hefty topics that shouldn't be thrown around lightly. While it is understandable to focus on Cal's experience of an estranged parent (played by the formidable Camilla Makhmudi), the play misses on delving deeper into her very cruel ending. When another death is mentioned, it is seemingly only to point out some casual racism which sets Nat, rightfully, off. Even though Cal shows signs of upset about her loss, she is apparently not allowed to dwell on it since (casual) racism is a more pressing matter. When death does take centre-stage, it is only in a clichéd form, meaning to say goodbye to all matters in the past and look towards the future. The play does indeed what it promises, though instead of being selfish it appears it is more self-centered.</p><p>All journeys, outward and inward, start with the intention of reaching a hopefully better destination. The confrontatational setting of sheeted-up furniture at <em>Compartmentalisation 101</em>'s finale is a haunting reminder of the realities of life - and that we should indeed focus on our actions in the future. </p><p><em>Compartmentalisation 101 runs at the Bedlam Theatre until 13 February 2020. </em></p>",

      "html": "<p>“Why is there one rule for Muslims, and another for everyone else?” </p><p>This is the question at the root of <em>Trojan Horse, </em>which revisits the 2014 scandal of the same name. Trojan Horse emerged when claims of an alleged conspiracy to radicalise Birmingham schoolchildren reached the city council. Although there was little evidence for extremism and the claims are now recognised as false, press and politicians alike jumped on the story, launching emergency inspections, disrupting education and eventually ending the careers of several teachers.</p><p><em>Trojan Horse </em>is not set up as a traditional play. Rather than a beginning, middle and end narrative, it is done in excerpts, almost flashback-style. Characters representing the real-life figures associated with the affair deliver speeches to the audience in first person; dialogue is present, but it is used mainly to compliment these. This style is attributable to the fact that <em>Trojan Horse </em>was compiled from interviews, a technique that kept the play fairly even-handed.</p><p>The accounts did keep the audience hooked. There was genuine tension as the events unfolded, and the stakes were high from all angles: chair of governors Tahir faces the possibility of being banned from education; Rashid Wasi, head of modern languages at Park View school, fears being imprisoned on terrorism charges; and student Farah is overwhelmed by worries about her sexuality, exams, and her reception by mainstream British society as a Muslim.</p><p>But the tension and emotionality are not the only things keeping this play going: it is funny, well-paced, and definitely entertaining. The areas I found comparatively less stunning were still by no means bad: the acting was good, and the set minimalistic but perfectly all right.</p><p>But even in the areas in which the play itself didn’t blow me out of the water, the Q&amp;A did. The panel seems to change with each show, but in my case involved academic Dr. Elshayyal, whose research centres around British Muslims; a representative from anti-Islamophobia organisation MEND; and two of the teachers at the heard of the Trojan Horse scandal, whose stories had just been told onstage. The opportunity for direct conversation with them ultimately highlights the real strength of the production: its evident desire and ability to spark dialogue.</p><p><em>Trojan Horse runs at the Traverse Theatre until 12 February 2020. </em></p>",

With warnings of strobe lighting, partial nudity, violence and drug use, there was a tangible sense of anticipation from the audience. </p><p>From the costumes (Katie May Anderson), which were grungy and sexy - and I'm pretty sure almost everyone was in a pair of Dr. Martens - to the sparse staging (Elsie Greenwood) of just two mattresses on the floor, the play's lasciviousness was almost palpable. The commitment to having the play performed at Hive was fantastic. The <em>'Tis Pity She's A Whore</em> club stamp set the tone and there was no mistaking where you were. It was almost as though Hive was a silent character in the play, with your own memories of messy drunk nights out bubbling just below the surface, amplifying the illicit atmosphere encouraged by being in a nightclub out of hours. </p><p>The play was performed on the main dance floor, and seating was arranged down the sides and on the DJ platform. From the offset, it was high tempo and enthralling. The cast burst on to the floor, dancing wildly, snorting drugs and drinking. Ben Goldby (Grimaldi) was particularly provocative, and the audience were immediately thoroughly immersed in the action of the play.</p><p>The entire cast was exceptional, and they made 1600s English sound perfectly at home in the otherwise modern surroundings. Aside from the language, there was no way of knowing that this was a play written almost 400 years ago, as the themes of sexuality, illicit love and misogyny still feel very relevant. It was an incredible performance, and definitely a night at Hive that I didn't regret the next morning! </p><p><em>'Tis Pity She's A Whore runs at The Hive Nightclub until 11 February 2020.</em></p>",

When son Ki-Woo is offered a job tutoring a girl from the elite Park family, he sees an opportunity, and the Kims quickly find themselves spinning lies to climb up the wealth ladder. What starts off as a well-paced comedy takes a sudden dark turn, and the Kims are left more desperate than ever to retain their newly-acquired positions.</p><p>The film is flawless and thorough; director Bong Joon-ho seems to have thought of every detail, and is relentless in his portrayal of division between the Parks and the Kims. The characters are an important part of this: there is a sense of practicality, toughness and independence in the Kim family, which has grown out of necessity—the Parks, meanwhile, are mostly naive and vacant. Their lack of hardship means they are able to appear nice. Bong Joon-ho does not present us with miserly, cruel rich people, nor does he portray the poor as existing solely to be pitied; his characters have been profoundly affected by their lack of wealth.</p><p>The cast, therefore, had a significant challenge in front of them. The Kims had to be presented warts-and-all, yet remain sympathetic, or at the very least, understandable. On this front, they did an excellent job. Song Kang-ho, who played Kim family patriarch Ki-taek, and who is a favourite actor of Bong Joon-ho, expressively captured his character’s wavering pride and desperation. Park So-dam, who played daughter Ki-jeung, was also particularly good at giving a subtle charm to her direct, shrewd character. The characterisation of the Park family was also well-done, in particular Cho Yeo-jeong’s Yeon-kyo, a humorously-portrayed out-of-touch mother, who despite her cluelessness was not reduced to a flat stereotype.</p><p>The set design also emphasised the class distinction. The semi-basement home of the Kim family, a narrow-walled space set in a warm lighting, was the polar opposite to the wide and spacious house, which used a cool palette of off-whites and slate-greys. Where the basement flat was cluttered, the house was open-plan, minimalist and sterile. Most notably, the lighting is different: the Kims have one narrow, high window in their living room, which is their only source of natural light. The Parks, meanwhile, have entirely glass wall, and the film plays with the visual implications of this effectively (but to tell you how would spoil it).</p><p>There is symbolism and meaning to be found everywhere: the heavy rain from the thunderstorm, the insects that fly around the houses, even the contents of the Parks’ fridge (among them a collection of VOSS-brand water bottles and a sirloin steak). These details and the storyline as a whole comprise a sophisticated, innovative and entertaining take on class inequality that is truly incredible.</p><p><em>Parasite<em> is in cinemas now.</em></em></p><p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Reviewed as Film of the Week, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CameoCinema/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAKPislawMGrxiIlOlKYIP0GVXzfAUHgmBMjXHmpalXq5DqZ0ekPOKWkVhdpl0anMOypoM_ffelobqg&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3m5rVwBfwOJBI9lTeXSVSV4IYSi-mkvNZrxLjX3sf9xQMBIfwQHqmnOVhTFYMde1OP-K_JXHjoyELZdbrRqQDXdlHV7H5DG6KX3FTQ1Fzhb3w-GoG7ijjb_l1NfYC7DJv3itREpuLqx53UleCbHFCPh1eylwt12_xPafkq3MvN_UySxZGvJea5I8ZySnFlrWmbaCut5-8BkE3Ga1Ro4DBM_S-mnuCuqcAOjZTcwpJqLTYt5CiI89TWL2qeKxQIcA6kU0MUg_evAWOWlP6z0X2xgsM-IjI0zCr9irfz-vyW5yJGaFEwKoHbNAOIRGXXX4EEs4yA24RniNW96daiVU\">Cameo Cinema</a>, Edinburgh</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em>.</p>",

      "html": "<p><br>True to its American 1920s inspiration, Edinburgh University Footlights have managed to not only create a night of magic on stage, but to transform the entire space into an immersive experience of 1920s Vaudeville. From the round cocktail tables up front, to the soft red candle light illuminating the orchestras brass instruments and sheet music – <em>Chicago </em>takes you to its bosom and makes you listen to its beating passionate heart. With astonishing singers such as Lauren Robinson (as Velma Kelly), Niam Higgins (as Matron 'Mama' Morton) and Matthew Storey (as Billy Flynn), anything less than amazing is simply not possible. In true 1920s fashion, they are surrounded by a whirling cast of ensemble members, who, quite literally, razzle and dazzle us away with their twirling and whirling. Expect to hear classics such as 'All that Jazz', 'Cell Block Tango' and 'Mr. Cellophane' all performed with as much honesty and enthusiasm you can expect from rightful crooks. </p><p>The high attention given to the choreography, under Florence Hardy's lead, elevates the neat performances to a highly professional level. It is refreshing to see the love and devotion given to the details that make a musical work, from the music performances, the actors and orchestra members' team play, to the lighting and clothing design –everything is coordinated in perfect harmony. Footlights manages to turn a script into an experience with just using the bare basics, raw talent, and a little bit of devious magic. Though I have never seen the original musical, nor the 2002 film, I'm in doubt if I would even want to spoil the experience of watching such a fantastic performance. </p><p>For the next few weeks to come, their evocative songs will certainly creep up on me again. As to what happens to anyone near me then? I didn't do it, he had it coming.</p><p><em>Chicago runs at the Pleasance Theatre until 8 February 2020.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>After seeing <em><a href=\"https://freshair.org.uk/posts/pride-and-prejudice-sort-of-review/\">Pride and Prejudice* (*Sort Of)</a> </em>at the Lyceum Theatre,  I was intrigued to see what would be said at the Lyceum's corresponding <em>Talk Show</em> inspired by the production. </p><p>The guest speakers were both well selected and extremely knowledgable on Jane Austen's work and her life. Led by Mariella Frostrop, she was joined by Helena Kelly, author of <em>Jane Austen, the Secret Radical</em>, Helen McClory, a Scottish writer, and Emma Claire Sweeney, Director of The Ruppin Agency Writers' Studio and a lecturer at the Open University. </p><p>The discussion was framed with music from \"the fragrant\" (as she was introduced by Mariella Frostrop) Siobhan Wilson, a locally based singer-songwriter, whose voice was delightfully haunting. </p><p>The topic of the conversation largely followed the speakers' thoughts on McArthur's adaptation, and often, how this compared to the original novel. However, they also discussed Jane Austen's image in the modern world, and the fact that she is less uptight and proper as people seem to assume. </p><p>Whilst the talk was animated, interesting, and rather funny, there was the assumption that everybody in the room was very familiar with Jane Austen and her works. Truthfully, everybody in the theatre that evening most probably was, myself included. Yet, because the play that inspired the <em>Talk Show</em> is extremely accessible to all, Austen fanatics and novices alike, it did surprise me to find that this was not so much the case at this event. </p><p>The evening ended with the panel reading out alternate endings written by the audience to <em>Pride and Prejudice's</em> famous first line: 'It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man...' In keeping with Jane Austen and the evening as a whole, these were witty, biting, and often political. </p><p><em>Talk Show is supported by James and Morag Anderson.</em></p><p><em>Pride and Prejudice* (*sort of) <em>runs at the Lyceum Theatre until 15 February 2020.</em></em></p>",

      "title": "Bombay Bicycle Club",
      "html": "<p>Before the first of their two sold out shows at Glasgow’s Barrowlands, Esmé Haddrill Selman and Maisie Wills got the opportunity to chat with Jamie MacColl and Ed Nash of Bombay Bicycle Club about their recent hiatus, the new record and the current state of music in 2020.</p><p><strong>You’ve had quite a big break between releasing music and playing together?</strong></p><p>Yeah, about four years.</p><p><strong>How did the time apart shape you as individuals and feed into the music of Bombay Bicycle Club now?</strong></p><p>Ed: How did it shape what we see now? I mean, we all went off and did these things we weren’t able to do when we were in the band, just because of time commitments and it’s all we’d done our whole lives. We were 15/ 16 and it had been our whole time in school as well as the time immediately after that.</p><p>Jamie went to university, which he couldn’t do before hand and me and Jack made our own solo records. Suren started playing drums for others such as Jessie Ware and other artists. All of this massively influenced the band now and how we operate as a group.  You know? I spent all my time writing and recording music and now I have a better understanding I can help with that aspect of the band. I think doing that as well as all of our other individual projects gave us another side to ourselves, whereas beforehand it was only the band and it could be quite one dimensional. I mean, Jamie’s course [Philosophy] really helped that too.</p><p>Jamie: Yeah, our identities were very tied up with being in the band; both in how we perceived ourselves and how others would then perceive us. I think it was just, I know it’s a cliché, but finding out who you are.</p><p><strong>Yeah and, from the perspective of both of us studying art degrees the idea of a creative process is something familiar to us. The idea of stepping away from projects and returning after a while can be really beneficial to what you create, do you feel this with Bombay?</strong></p><p>Ed:  Yeah totally, I think we started taking it for granted after touring the last album. You know? We’d be in all these really exciting cities doing what we loved but we’d be so tired and just take the whole opportunity for granted, we felt like we didn’t want to be there. I think it’s good to take a break just so you can really take stock of what you have and appreciate it and yeah, that what we did and its massively shaped the way the band is now.</p><p><strong>And now you’ve all come back and formed this band after doing things non-music related. Jamie, you went and studied philosophy, and do you feel as though this has shaped the music in any way?</strong></p><p>Jamie: Hahahaha, no but I think it benefitted the way I which we thought about the album as a whole and presented ourselves as a band. I’d spent four years thinking conceptually so I was interested in finding broader themes to talk about with the album. Sometimes that was slightly extrapolating things as you’re taught to do in a humanities degree, things which perhaps aren’t there but it helps create a more interesting narrative.</p><p><strong>Yeah, do you think then that influenced <em>your </em>input into the album, conceptually speaking?</strong></p><p>Jamie: Not particularly in that I don’t write the music, but I suppose I feel as though I kind of critique it from an outside perspective, in a way.</p><p><strong>Reflecting on it?</strong></p><p>Jamie: Yeah exactly, which can be useful in the process of getting from the stage of writing the music to producing it and creating a finished product. But I can safely say that nothing I’ve studied over the last four years has made its way into Bombay Bicycle Club.</p><p><strong>Yeah, we were both saying after listening through to the new album that it does feel more reflective and maybe optimistic in a way? And that optimism is so interesting as I feel like it’s harder to make optimistic records in the current time, but this makes it more important. Do you feel like the album is more optimistic?</strong></p><p>Jamie: Yeah definitely. It’s meant to be joyful and positive, which I think is similar to the Big Moon’s new album, who are supporting us on this tour. It’s about finding hope. And how music itself can be a hope, and even just instrumental music can be uplifting. So yeah that’s one element of it and then also there’s the lyrics which I feel are more optimistic. Love and heartbreak kind of dominated our first four albums whereas this is more about finding your place in the world and finding a place to be happy and navigate all the stuff that you have to do as an adult rather than an eighteen-year-old.</p><p><strong>Yeah, I guess those are really big ideas?</strong></p><p>Jamie: Yeah and then in some ways they’re not because that’s how life feels sometimes. And it’s more about us adjusting to normality. Our lives were very much not normal, seven or eight years after we left school, we were just doing the band. And then for a while it was good to get back to normality.</p><p>Ed: hahahah but now we’ve been thrown back into abnormality.</p><p><strong>Yeah, and forming the band in school you were obviously all close friends and still are, but how is it actually creating things with friends? Because sometimes its hard to find that necessary distance when working with friends but I think a lot of creative people are drawn towards it, how’s it been for you?</strong></p><p>Ed: You think the same as your friends and I think that’s how a lot of us formed our friendship initially. Jamie and Jack formed their friendship on going to see the same gigs and talking about bands they both likes. You know? You have those things in common and that’s why creative projects work with people you like. I don’t think it would be that easy to work with people who you fundamentally disagree with. That’s definitely where all this started but I think if you look at most bands they’re friends as well… or rather were at some point.</p><p><strong>And coming back to what you were saying about the importance of having some normality, and now stepping back into that almost abnormal space in 2020, a completely different era compared to 2009 when the first album was released. How does it feel to be making music in these much more turbulent times as compared to back then?</strong></p><p>Jamie: I mean, I say it was a lot more care-free then but actually we’d just had a massive global recession which affected music, less people going to gigs and buying records. But people weren’t politically engaged in the way they are now. I think it still feels as though politics is something which happens to you as opposed to something <em>you </em>can shape. I think that even when we stopped in early 2015 was before the first wave of elections which made everything feel a lot more troubled but there really wasn’t that much political music. As a band, you would never get asked about politics in interviews and you know, we aren’t a particularly political band. We don’t make protest music. But I mean now, everyone in the arts is asked to talk about politics. That’s very different to 2009 and even 2015.</p><p>Now, we go for a week of promo in Germany and people will be asking us to explain Brexit. I don’t think we have any authority to say that, I mean there are people far more qualified than us. I don’t know though; I haven’t really decided how I feel about whether artists are duty bound to have an opinion on politics. I’m from a family of very politically active folk musicians and they’re position would be that ‘all art is political’ and there is a necessity for it to be political, but we definitely don’t approach making music in that way.</p><p><strong>Yeah, coming back to what you were saying about creating a much more optimistic album, which is so joyful to listen to when everything seems bleaker.</strong></p><p>Jamie: yeah, and you could argue that being optimistic is a political statement but maybe that’s a bit of a reach? Still though, being optimistic about the future is a choice you make and to be optimistic about the future is to be optimistic about the society we live in and hope that the socio-political landscape will get better than it is now. Although, I don’t think <em>our </em>music is actually going to help that but you know?</p><p><strong>Even if it is removed from politics, I still feel there’s important stuff to be said in it in that if people enjoy it, it can provide a sense of relief?</strong></p><p>Jamie: Yeah, I think art goes through these periods of realism and then into escapism and I think that’s certainly a tension in music at the moment. Certainly in the press at the moment there is a lot of interest in political realist music and I think that’s very reflective of political debates at the moment but again, we don’t really do that as such but I’m interested in talking about it!</p><p><strong>Do you think then that art has had an influence in your music?</strong></p><p>Jamie: In terms of visual art? Yeah! Well, Ed is a painter.</p><p>Ed: Yeah, I’m interested in visual art and think it’s important to stay switched on to it. In the years we had a way from the band all of us paid attention to other music, film, painting, art, radio and the rest of it even if sometimes there doesn’t feel like there’s a strong connection between it and our music.</p><p>Jamie: I think art has had a big impact on the way we present ourselves as a band outside of the music. I do genuinely think our artwork is better than 99 percent of other artists releasing music hahaha. Over the last few years our production and lights at the live shows has been influenced by visual arts. Our last album, because the music was very loop-based and electronic we started talking about Edward Muybridge, the photographer, who’s art reflected this idea about looping and repetitions. So, we started incorporating that visually into the artwork and the lightshows as well as the video content. So often it can be the music, I guess, which dictates how we then represent ourselves visually rather than the other way around.</p><p><strong>Staying on the art tangent, what kind of albums really have been formative for you throughout your musical careers but then also just in life?</strong></p><p>Ed: I think the sound of Bombay Bicycle Club changed a huge amount over the last four albums and that probably related pretty closely to the kind of music we were listening to.</p><p>Jamie: yeah, I think it’s quite easy to chart what we were listening to at the time of each album.</p><p>Ed: yeah, apart from this most recent one which is perhaps far more eclectic and draws on lots of other influences. But for the first album we were listening to a lot of guitar music then for the second we started listening to a lot more folk and acoustic. The on to electronic, hip-hop and sample based music.</p><p>Jamie: I think it was stuff like Joy Division, My Bloody Valentine and Pavement for guitar and chord progressions. And The Strokes! We were listening to quite a lot of heavy guitar movement when we made <em>I Had the Blues</em> but I’m not sure if that heaviness is reflected in the album.</p><p>Ed: A lot of mid to late music from the 2010’s is sort of lumped together, like us and The Maccabees but if you talk to them they were listening to bands like Talk Talk you know? Bands which didn’t sound like other British Indie bands and I think it kind of all unfairly gets lumped together without acknowledging the variety of different influences outside of <em>British </em>guitar movement.</p><p>Jamie: And then on the second album stuff like John Martyn, Bert Jansch, Joanna Newsom, Joni Mitchell, you know just a lot of classic folk artists. And then the third and fourth albums I can’t think of anything specific…</p><p>Ed: I think that’s when Jack started listening to a lot of hip-hop and he then started making beats in his own time. The experimental tracks jack had been making then wormed their way in to Bombay Bicycle Club. We never lost those old influences though and you carry them with you. With the newest album I think you can see the guitar influence of Pavement and then also elements of Joanna Newsom and then J Dilla and MF Doom.</p><p><strong>Yeah, and you can hear that in the album! I noticed the jazz influences a lot in the new album, which I really loved.</strong></p><p>Jamie: Yeah, definitely and in the opening song ‘Get Up’, there’s definitely jazz influences with the brass section and the drumming is a lot more free-form. And then also ‘I Worry Bout You’ has a lot of jazzier influences in.</p><p><strong>To kind of wrap things up, are there any artists now, musical or visual, that you’re excited about or interested in collaborating with?</strong></p><p>Ed: I don’t want to work with him, I think he’s an appalling person, but Mark Kozelek of Sun Kil Moon. I’m really taken with his music. I mean, he’s an awful person but I’m trying to separate the artist from the art and he is just increasingly making this really meta music. Each album is just becoming more of a stream-of-consciousness which I can’t get over and I really like it. I don’t know of anyone else who is making music quite like that, however I don’t want to work with him.</p><p>Jamie: I’m trying to think of visual artists, but I don’t know, I feel very disconnected from contemporary visual art and poetry which I think is quite easy to feel unless you’re part of a scene. But there are some musical artists I really like who are doing some really interesting stuff like Soccer Mommy, just because I haven’t heard guitar music I’ve really liked in a while. Her music is so of a time, influenced by 90s new wave, bit Pavement, which I really like but then it also has such a pop sensibility to it. There’s not a huge amount I’m excited about in the world we are currently in but I do really like The Big Moon’s new album. I think it’s quite a brave record to make. I think, it’s a cliché to say it, but there is arguably music more exciting pop music than indie music happening right now.</p><p><strong>Would you still define Bombay as “indie”? I know that’s a label which can be annoying due do how it’s kind of become an umbrella term for a huge variety of music.</strong></p><p>Jamie: Yeah, I mean you search “indie” on Spotify and it just becomes a catchall for anything with a guitar in it… or even music which doesn’t.</p><p>Ed: At the beginning it annoyed me. I go back and listen to the more recent records and I just don’t know how it can be described as “indie”, it’s much more of a pop record.</p><p>Jamie: I think it [“indie”] is a particularly loaded term in this country because the concept of “landfill indie” doesn’t carry nearly as much currency elsewhere. But it’s definitely a word to swat away something you don’t like essentially. I think we have found that difficult over the years but maybe it’s quite useful to have a chip on your shoulder to push you through. In a way, I’d rather be doing it now than in the early 2000s when it was so ubiquitous and harder to stand out.</p><p>Bombay Bicycle Club are currently <a href=\"https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/bombay-bicycle-club-tickets/artist/41055?camefrom=cfc_uk_blog_\">on tour in the UK</a> with their new album ‘Everything Else Has Gone Wrong’.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" title=\"Spotify Embed: Everything Else Has Gone Wrong\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/11yHtE6IzOk6elh9cJzldJ?si=mEeWEqR4RoGd8mnQFm2jbw\"></iframe></figure>",

      "title": "The Lighthouse Review",
      "html": "<p>Disturbing, moody and absurd, <em>The Lighthouse</em> is a powerful depiction of two lighthouse-keepers descending into madness. On a misty and deserted island, their only job is to keep the light burning: sombre Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) toils in the engine-room, cleans out the cistern and undertakes the heavy labour, while his superior, a rugged yet poetic former sea-captain named Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) spends his working hours in self-seclusion upstairs, maddening Winslow with his mysterious refusal to let him see what he does there. Alcohol and paranoia play their part, and the pair struggle to maintain a grip on reality, leaving characters and audience alike unsure what is real and what is not.</p><p>Director Robert Eggers made his debut in 2015 with his critically-acclaimed <em>The Witch</em>, the story of a Puritan family in early modern America as they spiral following the disappearance of their infant son. Viewers of <em>The Witch </em>may know what to expect from Eggers: jarring pacing, a screaming score, and a distinctively art-house feel. Yet his talent is in making these elements fit seamlessly in their context, making seemingly drastic creative choices (in this case, filming in black-and-white and integrating historical accents) seem natural and unpretentious.</p><p>Eggers drew from a variety of inspirations: allusions to Herman Melville, Sarah Orne Jewett, Greek mythology, sailors’ superstitions, historical mysteries, and The Tempest (among others) all contribute to the atmosphere. References never feel ham-fisted; they are just there to nourish the story. Whether of the sea, the craggy rocks or the lighthouse itself, the shots painted the gloominess vividly in black-and-white, while the score by Mark Korven (who also collaborated with Eggers in 2015) blurred the line between onscreen sound effects and the soundtrack, particularly in its use of the clock and the foghorn. There was also a truly incredible use of seagulls.</p><p>Pattinson and Dafoe were also excellent. Pattinson was strikingly expressive, particularly in his character’s wilder moments, while Dafoe performed with an almost manic calm, and I am not sure whether some of his speech was genuinely written in verse or whether he just leaned into its natural rhythm. Together, they form a strange and mutating power dynamic which is interesting to watch. The two also handled the unpredictable shifts from humour to terror well, although these sudden tonal changes did prevent the building of gradual tension that was so palpable in <em>The Witch—</em>in <em>The Lighthouse, </em>the caprice of the sea transfers to its captives<em>.</em></p><p><em>The Lighthouse </em>is an intense watch, and I’m conscious that this review is in fact also very intense. But that’s the power of it: it is immersive and affecting, and more than anything, it stays with you.</p><p><em>The Lighthouse is in cinemas now.</em></p><p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Reviewed as Film of the Week, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CameoCinema/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAKPislawMGrxiIlOlKYIP0GVXzfAUHgmBMjXHmpalXq5DqZ0ekPOKWkVhdpl0anMOypoM_ffelobqg&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3m5rVwBfwOJBI9lTeXSVSV4IYSi-mkvNZrxLjX3sf9xQMBIfwQHqmnOVhTFYMde1OP-K_JXHjoyELZdbrRqQDXdlHV7H5DG6KX3FTQ1Fzhb3w-GoG7ijjb_l1NfYC7DJv3itREpuLqx53UleCbHFCPh1eylwt12_xPafkq3MvN_UySxZGvJea5I8ZySnFlrWmbaCut5-8BkE3Ga1Ro4DBM_S-mnuCuqcAOjZTcwpJqLTYt5CiI89TWL2qeKxQIcA6kU0MUg_evAWOWlP6z0X2xgsM-IjI0zCr9irfz-vyW5yJGaFEwKoHbNAOIRGXXX4EEs4yA24RniNW96daiVU\">Cameo Cinema</a>, Edinburgh</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em>.</p>",

      "title": "Heroine Review",
      "html": "<p>Writer and performer Mary Jane Wells describes this play as “a compassion grenade”. Such a juxtaposition of humanity and violence sums up <em>Heroine </em>perfectly and it is rare that you find a piece of theatre which so delicately manages to balance the funny with the shocking, the heartfelt with the raw, but this play manages to cover this wide spectrum of emotions all the while remaining grounded in the reality of the issues it addresses.<br></p><p><em>Heroine</em> is a one woman show, written and performed by Mary Jane Wells, in which she plays Danna Davis. Davis is a lesbian soldier in the US Army, who is violently raped by three of her male colleagues and then goes on to serve alongside one of them in a mission in Iraq. Wells’ fine use of words and smart use of physicality brings Danna’s interactions and inner thoughts to life. She seems to float from memory to memory before us and even on a blank stage, we believe we are with her in her therapy sessions, in the Iraqi war zone, and in the back of the car where she is assaulted. <br></p><p>Part of the testament to this transportive world created in a bare black box theatre is the admirable work in lighting and sound, designed by George Tarbuck and Matt Padden respectively. The shapes projected onto the floor, each illuminating a section of the stage where Wells portrays different facets of Danna’s life, are refreshing and unusual. The lighting changes to take us into Danna’s thoughts are sharp and well thought through, leaving no confusion as to their purpose for the audience, as non-naturalistic lighting often risks doing. The sound design is similarly well thought through and adds depth and realism to all aspects of the play, if being slightly too overbearing and intense at points.<br></p><p>What really makes this play stand out though is the conversations it starts and the light it brings to issues which many are not aware even exist. In 2017 it was estimated that 80% of sexual assault cases in the US Army went unreported and out of the average 22 veteran suicides everyday, 18 of those are military sexual trauma survivors. Danna’s story ends with hope, hope for her moving forward with her life, healing and forgiving and changing her relationship with the past. However, not all stories end this way and the insular institutions of the US and British Armies are unequipped to support survivors in the correct ways, an issue which this play exposes in stark light. Mary Jane Wells’s ‘Heroine’ proves, in her own words, that “artistic energy and healing energy are the same thing, with different focus\". </p><p><em>Heroine runs at the Traverse Theatre until 1 February 2020. </em></p>",

      "html": "<p>First broadcast in November 2015, Branagh Theatre Live’s <em>The Winter’s Tale </em>conquered the UK cinema box office, beating <em>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2</em>. Though no dystopia, Rob Ashford and Kenneth Branagh’s production is firmly rooted in traditional Shakespearean landscapes – perhaps an even more distant world.</p><p>Branagh’s red-lit Leontes is plagued with insane envy over his wife’s suspected adultery, ultimately jeopardising his own family, friends, and succession. Accused and persecuted by their rash male counterparts, the female characters (and actors) shine within this performance. Miranda Raison’s Hermione exudes assured self-belief, providing powerful, emotional oratory in her own trial. Judi Dench delivers a calculated Paulina, exposing both the character’s strong defiance and humanistic sympathies. Emphasizing that <em>‘It is an heretic that makes the fire, Not she which burns</em> <em>in’t’,</em>this seemingly orthodox production explores and exposes complex gender hierarchies.</p><p>Subtle transitions between Christopher Oram’s well-crafted sets transport the audience from Sicilia and Bohemia, and an equally stretching timescale. Indeed, plentiful close-up shots and an equally dramatic soundtrack make this live performance often more cinematic than theatrical. At times, such effects are perhaps unnecessary, particularly in the portrayal of the tale’s beast. Only the live audience laughter, particularly in the second half of the performance, re-establishes the actual Garrick Theatre setting.</p><p>Dench’s image may dominate the production’s promotions, but the ensemble should be equally commended. Jessica Buckley as Leontes’ long-lost daughter Perdita embraces the rural Bohemia setting, the radiant queen of a shepherding celebration. John Dagleish’s nimble-fingered Autolycus, John Shraphnel’s conscientious courtier Camillo, and Jimmy Yuill’s oddball shepherd offer equally adept performances.</p><p>Branagh’s powerful production and able ensemble deliver a solid rendition of Shakespeare’s classic. Even less ardent fans of the Bard will enjoy this bold, engaging piece.</p><p><em>Branagh Theatre Live: The Winter’s Tale was screened at the Festival Theatre on 30 January 2020.</em></p>",

Notes of adoration pour from his lettertrays, the weight of his audiences’ expectations bears heavy, and he’s positively ‘bulging with confidences’ – the closeted skeletons of his theatre crew. It’s <em>terribly</em> lonely, being so adored.</p><p><em>Present Laughter</em> – originally titled <em>Sweet Sorrow </em>– exposes the underlying vulnerability of narcissistic theatrical types, unravelling their amusing webs of scandal. Farce-fanatics rejoice - it is purely decadent melodrama. Andrew Scott’s Essendine is a petulant child, crawling and scowling with infantile resolve (despite his age – don’t ask). Yet, his charm – and swooning recitations of Shelley – earn him the affections of his peers, resulting in some tantalisingly loaded moments.</p><p>Noël Coward’s 1939 comedy is refreshed with subtle gender swaps, reinforcing the piece’s bohemian context. Coward’s script, thankfully, remains unchanged. Interwoven stories revolve around perpetually ‘misplaced’ latchkeys, perhaps a subtle nod to Waugh’s <em>Vile Bodies </em>– another satirical look on the ‘problems’ of post-war London’s BYTs. Scott races through tongue-twisting rants, the audience suspended until the final lick. In one particularly outrageous explosion, Essendine bolshily concludes that sex is only as satisfying as ‘an apple and a good book’.</p><p>Director Matthew Warchus orchestrates the carefully constructed chaos. Doors slam, phones ring, all in perfect comic timing. The troupe’s energy is catching, their volume ever-increasing – it’s a miracle they survive the near-three-hour shouting match.</p><p>Essendine might be the centerpiece - in his presence, even the meekest characters explode into emotional uproar – but the ensemble exacts control. Clever staging leaves Scott bound by the hands, or force fed sweet treats – subtle reminders of the actor’s stifled sentiments. Essendine’s long-suffering ‘warship’ secretary Monica Reed, played by Sophie Thompson, and tongue-in-cheek valet Fred, played by Joshua Hill, subtly rival Scott’s star.</p><p>Unapologetically indulgent, <em>Present Laughter</em>’s boundless energy guarantees a smirk to even the tightest-lipped of audiences.</p><p><em>Present Laughter was screened at the Festival Theatre on 26 January 2020 as part of National Theatre Live’s 10th Birthday Season.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>The greatest tragedy is that I have so few words to review this play. <em>Her Romeo </em>was an utterly momentous piece of theatre. It contained an all-encompassing emotional range, at times bright and humorous, at other harrowing and murderous. Never in my life had I felt so truly stunned and distraught at a piece of scripted murder, however, I am getting ahead of myself here.</p><p><em>Her Romeo </em>is a fantastic retelling of <em>Romeo and Juliet </em>through the eyes of Benvolia, Romeo’s greatest friend and victim of a deep unrequited love with him. The play impressively stays very true to the original Shakespearian script, maintaining almost all the original text. However, through a staggeringly well-done restructuring of perspective and composition <em>Her Romeo </em>has somehow achieved the feat of adding further complexity to one of Shakespeare’s greatest works.</p><p>To attempt the herculean task of explaining all that I found awe-inspiring in so brief a space: The play begins with a heartfelt but originally elusive utterance from Benvolia during which her fellow actors march chaotically around the stage in a disordered fury of frenzied speech. Until all is still and Charlie Woolley leaps upon a table to deliver the iconic opening lines: ‘Two households, both alike in dignity,/ In fair Verona, where we lay our scene’. This is just one of many examples of the wondrous staging and complex direction this play has to offer. From astoundingly convincing choreographed violence to the construction of Juliet’s balcony out of the bodies of fellow actors, this production was at all times intriguing and engaging. Never before have I seen such versatility achieved with a simple set design of a table and a portable door. To briefly give credit where it is due in a criminally reductive way. The use of music was absorbing and perfectly executed. The partnership of the intense drama of the play with the vigorous music of The White Stripes, The Police, The Kings of Leon and so much more instilled a great vitality to the piece. The lighting was also fantastic, it was utilised with a huge amount of variety and effect yet done so fluidly as to never intrude on the immersion of the play.</p><p>In terms of the actors, all were marvellous, confident and convincing, yet, of course, some were beyond enthralling and worthy of particular note. The greatest acting can all be epitomised in the blood stilling scene of Mercutio’s murder and Tybalt’s subsequent demise. As Mercutio lay dying in heart rending fear, Romeo leaps over his body and drags Tybalt to the ground then beats her to death with his bare fits, skin hitting skin with such a palpable noise that the entire audience was silent in horror. Fergus Head’s depiction of Mercutio throughout the play was a marvel of perfect characterisation. At times playful and quarrelsome, at others a man with the capacity to hold a strength of emotion that would annihilate most people.  Yann Davies’ Romeo was at once the immature lover and the devastated human, and at all times utterly captivating. However, the greatest and most enthralling display came from Olivia Thom’s Benvolia. Her beautifully natural and understated rendition of the tragedy of this onlooking unrequited lover left me heartbroken. Thom carries the power to cast the emotion of her acting right into the chests of the audience and force them to endure a complex range of human experience.</p><p>In short, Becca Chadder has put on one of the finest pieces of theatre I have seen in a very long time. I have nothing but utmost respect and admiration for her and her cast.</p><p><em>Her Romeo performed at the Bedlam Theatre on 25 January 2020, as part of BEDFEST 2020. </em></p>",

Whether you've seen the film, the TV series, or actually read the book, you definitely will not have seen it like this before.</p><p>Be you a Jane Austen enthusiast, or completely adverse to her novels, Isobel McArthur's retelling of this age-old classic is definitely for everybody. With a female-only cast of just six actors, plus an armchair for the role of Mr Bennet, they are guaranteed to have you in fits of laughter.</p><p>In McArthur's adaptation, this famous love story is told, not by the characters themselves, but rather they're played by the servants and household staff that Austen neglects to mention in her stories. To help them tell the story the cast frequently burst into song in order to express the repressed emotions of Austen's characters. These were excellently chosen, but most memorable was Lizzie Bennet's (Meghan Tyler) rendition of Carly Simon's <em>You're So Vain </em>addressed to none other than Mr Darcy (Isobel McArthur). Who knew a song released over 150 years later could be so fitting!</p><p>Whilst Austen’s characters wittily avoid saying what they mean, McArthur’s are quite the opposite. Seeing the Bennet girls swearing is almost surreal, in that the uptight world of Austen is almost the antithesis of any vulgar language, and I don’t think I’m the only one to feel this way, for every F word brought forth a smattering of giggles from the audience.</p><p>The cast were met with a thoroughly well-deserved standing ovation at the end, and I honestly wish I could watch it again. Funny, feminist and full of sass – this is definitely Jane Austen reimagined for a modern-day audience.</p><p><em>Pride and Prejudice runs at the Lyceum Theatre until 15 February 2020.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p><em>The Closing of a Small and Insignificant Bowling Alley, </em>written by Ned Dunne and performed by The Counterminers, is a play that does not pertain to greatness, nor that much to high comedy, yet it is exactly in its imperfections that the beauty of this play lies. <em>Bowling Alley </em>is a play set in the made-up town of Longstanton concerning (as the title may suggest) the closing of a bowling alley after a strange and mysterious man from London (Rick) buys the building. The play follows the concerns and struggles of the bowling alley’s employees as they panic over the prospect of losing their jobs. The focus of the play is the plight of the manager ‘Sam’, a woman who has never left Longstanton, struggles with an alcoholic mother and feels unable to be anything but the manager of the bowling alley.</p><p>However, the plot is not the strength of this play. It is in fact the weakness of the plot that becomes the play’s greatest asset. The performance was filled with beautifully humorous moments of metadrama and utter destruction of the fourth wall. From players calling out the incongruities of the script, to utterance such as ‘Why do you have to say it like you’re in a play?’ and ‘This is my bit, can you fuck off’, to the very humorous set design containing novelties such as a sign above one exit which said ‘This way to other bowling lanes’ and a sign above another which said ‘This way to other plot lines’. However, the most successful and side-splitting metadramatic aspect came from the BBC Longstandon Radio interludes.</p><p>In between scenes the stage would go dark and the theatre would fill with the poorly recorded sound of men singing the BBC Longstandon Radio news jingle. At first these interludes contained news reports pertaining to the acquisition of a new soup cooker in Longstanton (surprisingly an aspect which becomes a major plot point), yet halfway through the play, the broadcast enters what it calls the ‘Metasection’ as a variety of pundits comment on the flaws and shortcomings of the script and performance. The ‘Metasection’ reaches its own metadramatic climax when an audience member with a microphone comments on the effectiveness of the radio interludes and ‘Metasection’ as a plot device. This is a play that unravels and undoes itself in a beautiful and hilarious fashion.</p><p>Beyond the metadramatic aspects there is also some fine writing and acting to be found. The character of Jess, a recently released cat murderer with a Hugh Jackman obsession, is a particularly absurd and amusing character. The relationship between Jess and Rick, is derisive, antagonistic and beautifully comic, culminating in the utterance ‘Every interaction with you in an embarrassment.’ The unexpected introduction of perfect French regarding the matter of a ‘Pret a Manger’ almost left me falling from my seat. Yet, to be the harshest critic, I did find that the play lacked the strength to carry the quite serious secondary narrative of the relationship between Sam and her alcoholic mother. However, as I said at the beginning, this is not a play you watch for its plot. It is a fantastic night of comedy and frivolity, which if the opportunity ever arises, I urge you to enjoy. </p><p><em>The Closing of a Small and Insignificant Bowling Alley performed at the Bedlam Theatre on 23 January 2020, as part of BEDFEST 2020.</em></p>",

      "title": "BEDFEST 2020: Twice Over Review",
      "html": "<p><em>Twice Over</em> begins with the soft melodies of an acoustic guitar played live on stage as audience members enter to find their seats. Yet, do not let this gentle introduction of melodious music lull you into any sense of comfort and security. Written by Eve Simpson and Jane Prinsley and performed by Eve Simpson and Francesca Sellors, <em>Twice Over </em>is a challenging and engaging play which follows the plight of two quite different working-class women both struggling with issues of politics and representation - one under the government of Margaret Thatcher, the other under the government of Theresa May.</p><p>The play hinges upon the failures of government to provide support for these two women in contrast to the love and protection they achieve or wish to achieve from their local communities. There is a strong narrative of localism and community values which is ever emphasised by the musical interludes of ‘Community Song’ performed by Eve Simpson. During two tumultuous times in which the position of a female prime minster encourages women to become increasingly reflexive upon the status of women in society and women in politics, community seems to offers a structure of support they find lacking elsewhere. It is a play composed of a myriad of intriguing devices. The play begins with a Shakespeare-esque opening monologue, performed in rhyming couplets, a rhyme scheme that reoccurs periodically throughout the play adding emphasis to key utterances. The lighting is muted and subtle, as is the set and design which focuses attention on the women acting and the words they utter.</p><p>The play’s greatest moment occurs at the climax in which both women must cast their votes in the general election. The scene is performed with a staggering visual dualism and cross temporal dialogue, as each woman in their respective periods struggle with the complexities of their position in who they should vote for. It climaxes in a powerful moment in which one decides to cast their vote ‘For the Many and not the Few’ whilst the other crumples the ballot paper in her hand uttering ‘A cross in a box. What for?’. As the viewer is sympathetic to the plights of both women, each respective action seems powerful and empowering for their own unique reasons. It is this complexity and contradiction which brings so much greatness to <em>Twice Over.</em></p><p>The final scenes of the play demonstrated immense fervour in both writing and performance. Each character offers impassioned speeches on the futility of voting, the lack of representation for women and the working class within politics, the expectations of womanhood. and the changing but ever-present structural obstructions to success and freedom that women must suffer in society. The comprehensive representation of these inner struggles is so impressive that it occasionally verges upon the tone of a lecture. The last speeches of the play demand upon the viewer to reconsider their fundamental concepts of politics, ideology and community. The play ends on a polemical and deeply personal tone, in which the viewer can truly feel the political zeal of the writers.</p><p><em>Twice Over performed at the Bedlam Theatre on 22 January 2020, as part of BEDFEST 2020. </em></p>",

      "title": "Rex Orange County",
      "html": "<p><br><em>Pony</em> by Rex Orange County is singer Alex O’Connor’s first album with a major-label, in this case, Sony Music Entertainment. It’s a collection of songs that appear to be different stages of the same story: the singer is depressed as he’s surrounded by toxic friends, but a girl he’s in a long distance relationship helps him through his depression, and encourages him to cut out his toxic relationships, and as a result, he’s recovering from depression. As if to reflect the repetitive nature of the theme, the songs all sound disappointingly monotonous - the highs and lows are never emphasised by an exciting beat. This really lets down some of the most engaging lyrics in the album.‌</p><p>The album’s first track, ‘10/10’ refers to how he personally rates his emotions, and introduces his depression. While aspiring to be fully happy (“a ten”), he feels “like a five.” He’s suicidal (“I had a year that nearly sent me off the edge”), but after cutting out toxic relationships, he’s recovering and feels more in control of his life (\"I'm comin' in Bruce Wayne.”). However, there’s nothing sonically to highlight the change in his mood. The line “no control over my emotions” sounds so controlled and withdrawn that it’s almost paradoxical. In fact, the whole song, like other songs in <em>Pony</em>, drones on as if he’s holding back his inner turmoil.‌</p><p>‘Always’ is vulnerable and thus likeable. Generally in <em>Pony,</em> his lyrics are honest and full of raw emotion, which is charming in its own way. He exposes how he has a habit of denying his problems, unless convinced otherwise. Sound-wise the melody’s mostly uninflected, except the crescendo in the chorus, which could be interpreted as him screaming out for help.‌</p><p>The backing trumpet and piano of ‘Laser Lights’ is refreshing to the ears after the uninteresting, repetitive sounds epitomising the album. The “shoes” indicate how quickly he’s walking through life, highlighting his distress of being at a complete standstill from burnout after “dancing” restlessly. ‌</p><p>The lyrics of ‘Face to Face’ display his hurt and pain. He implies he self-harms (\"you were unaware, I was fully clothed\"), which he hides from a girl who he’s in a long-distance relationship with (“two different countries… poor connection\"). He misses the girl massively, because she’s now his “only friend... My world got so much smaller this year,\" presumably because he’s burned bridges. ‘Stressed out’ is about distrust and paranoia (\"They wanna see me stressed out every day, I know it\") and disappointment (\"But when you're at your worst, they're not there\") he feels towards friends he’s cut ties with. ‘Never Had the Balls’ is about recovery after leaving toxicity. He feels more like himself  (\"I was lost, felt nothing at all but I'm coming back now, yeah\"). Before he cuts those ties, he’s hesitant - he has to constantly tell himself to (\"I shouldn't waste my precious time on anybody living off of mine\"), and he needs encouragement from his girlfriend, who reassures him that it will be the “best decision” he’s ever made. Like the rest of the album, the melody of the three songs are flat and drony, which is sad given that this album has so much potential.‌</p><p>‘Pluto Projector’ is about his appreciation and fondness for the girl he’s dating (“And it's you that knows my darkness”) and how he’s still very much in love with her (\"This right here still feels like the honeymoon, when you say my name, nothing's changed\"). Again, his emotions are cut short by synthesised, toned-down vocals preventing the track from becoming louder. In comparison, ‘Every Way,’ which deals with the same topic, has a slow tempo and gentle piano that reinforces the sadness in his voice, as if he’s about to burst into tears: both tears of joy in the girlfriend’s presence in his life (“It means the most, I hope you know\"); and tears of uncertainty about whether he can look after her (“I will care about you in every way I can\").‌</p><p>The disjointed bass that begins ‘It Gets Better’ is noticeable, and echoes the chaos in his life before his girlfriend enters it, which becomes more dynamic as it changes to a happier synth at “she changed the world I know” and as more levels are added to the second verse of the chorus, before going back to the disjointed bass. Sonically, this song portrays his emotions the best. ‌</p><p>What’s curious is that he chooses to end the track with ‘It’s Not the Same Anymore.’ If he’s recovering, why does he decide to end his life story on a sad note (\"It's not the same anymore I lost the joy in my face, My life was simple before\")? Perhaps he’s trying to show that recovery is a slow process and that ever since depression claimed him, he will never go back to being quite as happy as he was before.‌</p><p>Overall, for a sentimental track, he’s not being experimental enough. It feels like a step down from his previous albums <em>Apricot Princess </em>and <em>bcos u will never b free</em>, because although they were amateuristic, they were more experimental. Has contracting with a major-label stopped his musical venture? Funnily enough, he’s predicted that he’s “a five” but hopefully, in his future albums, he’ll be closer to a “ten.”‌‌</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" title=\"Spotify Embed: Pony\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5CNckxfLf4TCoMOoxgAU8l?si=eB1VrBYfQ6WTV_VqN2dj4w\"></iframe></figure>",

      "html": "<p>IMAGE: 'PRESSURE' (2019)</p><p>France-Lise McGurn, a Glasgow based artist, has exhibited an all-encompassing show of technical mastery by installing figurative paintings and three-dimensional neon sculptures into the space of the Tramway gallery. Through fluid and spilling bodily gestures as well as life drawing, the gallery walls, doors, pillars and windows are incorporated into a harmonious state of being which co-exist, one in which a body is in motion while thus also being emotional; <em>In Emotia. </em>McGurn’s brush strokes create nuances that inhabit the canvases and are reiterated on the walls where they are hung. There is a dynamic conversation, a feeling that I as a viewer, and as a woman, felt addressed me, between the figures residing within the site-specific work; flesh tones against a gestured, washed background exchange the boundaries between one body and the next as well as one surface and another.</p><p>The repetition of congregated yet boundless gestures, such as that of the sweeping wrist or curling fingers, have been created with a clear and definite line of paint. As a viewer we can thus imagine a narrative whereby these multiples of figures, who overlay one another in particular moments or exist autonomously in others and acknowledge the escape of the picture plane, allow for an intimate exchange of bodies, <em>In Emotia. </em>I was able to participate in an obvious rhythm between the figures, of whom are mainly women, that of the over layering of paint in the installation itself as well as the bodies within the spaces they exist- aspects of McGurn’s own life and inhabited city cultures.</p><p>These now familiar figures have existed in night clubs and parties, an atmosphere re-created on the opening night of the show; the neon sculptures demanding their presence through the inside to the outside of the gallery, via the windows of which McGurn had also painted upon. The neon sculptures, such as ‘Anything That Moves “Vicky”’, add to the dynamism of the exhibition, the repetition of colour, line and form is one associated with the femininity of the woman’s body, from subtle pinks to intense reds, and their lived experiences. The successful spatial composition allows for a real navigation of the intimacy of space, reflecting light and paint in a back and forth motion. The bustling atmosphere of the opening night called for a one in, one out stream of exhibition visitors and thereby restated the club scene evocation of rhythmic bodies depicted in the figures themselves and the lives they live.</p><p>Stood on the street, outside of the exhibition and looking in, there was a real moment of existing within McGurn’s relational and immersive work; drawn into the scene and inwardly to oneself as a participant. This is certainly a pulsating exhibition that I would stand in line for again.</p><p><em>France-Lise McGurn: In Emotia runs at Tramway, Glasgow from 18 January until 22 March 2020.</em></p>",

      "title": "I Can Go Anywhere Review",
      "html": "<p>Douglas Maxwell’s ambitious new play, <em>I Can Go Anywhere</em>, blends 1960s Mod youth culture with modern day asylum narratives. Discrediting his upcoming citizenship test, Jimmy questions how knowing about Mod culture makes you any less British than knowing about dead kings and queens.  It doesn’t. Nevertheless, this stark question opens the debate per the role and instrumentalisation of (sub)cultures in Britain.</p><p>Actors Nebli Basani and Paul McCole are (self-admittedly) near caricatures of themselves, to great effect. Basani’s jittery Jimmy is the embodiment of Mod, exploding onto the piece engulfed within his oversized painted parka and pork pie hat. McCole, as the disillusioned cultural academic Stevie, counterweights Jimmy’s enthusiastic embrace of Mod culture in his elusive pursuit of asylum. Despite the surprising, sometimes inconsistent, acceleration of the storyline, the cast excel in livening their complex characters.</p><p>Fundamentally, <em>I Can Go Anywhere </em>is a celebration and critical take on youth culture. Maxwell’s script makes explicit the political instrumentalisation of culture for class and economic control, situating the Mods as hyperexaggerations of capitalist tropes. Counter to the inherent materialism of Mod culture, Stevie is sufficiently disenchanted to sacrifice his records, his most prized ‘things’.  Yet, this same culture is simultaneously used by both displaced characters for protection, as a ‘castle’ safe from the exclusionary cannons which threaten to fire their way.</p><p>A door and a target are the only persisting elements in Jen McGinley’s movable set. This stark, single-room layout facilitate the actors’ dynamism, and highlights the more subtle artistic choices. As the first door disappears, both Stevie and Jimmy are trapped in their absurd situation, forcing them to consider the piece’s challenging cultural questions.</p><p>In the post-show discussion, a Fred Perry-clad audience member proudly remarked a Noel Gallagher quip included in the piece, boasting its exact origin. <em>I Can Go Anywhere </em>explores and transcends these moments of personal identification within the cultural collective – in that, it hits its target.</p><p><em>I Can Go Anywhere runs at the Traverse Theatre until 21 December 2019.</em></p>",

Arms looped across the audience as we all sang, <em>We Wish You A Merry Christmas</em>, and snow delicately swirled atop our heads. Not a dry eye in the house. Yeah, it was pretty magical.</p><p>Sat in the Lyceum, I grinned throughout the play. The woman to the right of me turned at the interval to say: “it looks like the cinema come to life!”. I genuinely felt as if I were ten years old again, really living in the magic and wonder of Christmas. At my old age and with genuine need to check my phone every ten minutes, that’s real bona fide escapism.</p><p>Adapted, of course, from Charles Dickens’ well-loved <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, folklore has it that Dickens’ inspiration for the novel came from a trip to Edinburgh where he happened upon one Ebenezer Scrooge’s tombstone in Greyfriars Kirkyard. This play, under Tony Cownie’s direction, really feels as if it has brought the novel back home. Set in Victorian Edinburgh, and with the addition of everyone’s favourite dog Greyfriars Bobby, there’s more than enough feel-good mischief to go around.</p><p>What was truly brilliant, aside from the performances, was the set design. A truly first-class experience. Tiny Tim and wee Bobby are expertly directed puppets, the stage effortlessly transforms from Scrooge’s bedroom, to Old Town, to the castle, and the smoke-filled arrivals of the three spirits deliberately envelops the audience rows. There I was, in Victorian Edinburgh right inside the story itself.</p><p>Okay, I know you might think I have been a little overzealous in sharing my wide-eyed delight, but this performance soars above all holiday-related cheesiness and enters full blown, warm-glow inducing Christmas cheer. And if that doesn’t convince you, then a bah humbug to you sir!</p><p><em>An Edinburgh Christmas Carol runs at the Lyceum Theatre until 4 January 2020.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>The now-familiar bus ride to Leith Theatre always promises something unexpected, and this is no exception. Infamous for its riotous gypsy brass bashes at Edinburgh’s Summerhall, Balkanarama’s debut unplugged session snugly nestles in the Pianodome, an amphitheatre constructed entirely of pianos.</p><p>Acapella and acoustics transport the audience across the Balkans, ‘the crossroads of civilisation’ and thus stomping ground of many musical traditions. This is the soundtrack of my childhood; the wailing accordions and angry trumpets that kept me up past bedtime, as my dad refused to turn down the volume of his tinny computer speakers.</p><p>Mother of Balkanarama, Saska Saskahar, is musical compere, making occasional vocal cameos and recommendations. We share a love for Esma Redzepova, the proclaimed Queen of the Gypsies, to whom she commands the audience toast their drinks in respect.  Weaving between friends and familiar faces, Saskahar’s never without a devilish grin or warming spirit in hand (an essential – the Theatre has only cooled since last month’s <a href=\"https://freshair.org.uk/posts/leith-late-19-moon-party-review/\">Moon Party</a>). She’s an icon of Balkanarama as the black cat stamp with which you’re branded on entry; a musical community concerted by their Balkan connections, or vice versa.</p><p>Kuchke and UnuČad are polyphonic female voice choirs, recounting intoxicating tales of life, death, and lust, in the mountainous Balkans. Evocative lyrics are translated for the non-speakers – one woman warns ‘don’t step on my vineyards, don’t step on my grapes, don’t cheat me with your eyes’. A drum and voice Greek duo continued storytelling; the latter, with her flowing sleeves, curled locks, and wide eyes, bears a striking resemblance to a Balkan-sort-of-Kate-Bush. The women of these stories are ferocious, mischievous, and stand in solidarity, mirrored by the artists’ own loud and haunting harmonies. Consider this my plea to participate. </p><p>Established favourites Black Cat (joined by Leith Theatre favourite Lizabett Russo) and new five-piece Scotcha Republik offered the instrumental reply. Despite their recent formation, Scotcha are individual masters of brass, strings, keys, and percussion. Perfecting a mix of traditional pieces and new compositions – one such inspired by being chased for not stamping your Berlin metro ticket – I can’t tear my eyes away for one moment. The brazen trumpeter and saxophonist slide between the Pianodrome’s seats, disappearing and reappearing with an explosive riff. As fluid were the collective’s slips between demanding tempos and different songs. Then, the accordionist signals a deathly throat slice, and the band halts – only to fire up again. The musicians dwarfed their instruments, making them seem nothing more than toys. With pure childish delight, we needed no invitation to dance alongside them in the round.</p><p>For fans of Summerhall’s <em>Kalasnjikov</em> instrumental orgies, Balkanarama Sessions may seem a rather more muted affair. Maybe it’s my own nostalgia for late nights and<em> vruća rakija</em>, but this intimate setting only amplifies these musicians’ irresistible abilities, and the sense of community that Balkanarama commands.</p><p><em>Balkanarama Sessions performed at Leith Theatre on 5 December 2019.</em></p><p><em>For more information on upcoming events, visit <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/balkanarama1/\">facebook.com/balkanarama1/</a>.</em></p>",

      "title": "Strange Tales Review",
      "html": "<p>It is probably safe to assume that most Westerners aren't familiar with Pu Songling, let alone his collection of almost 500 stories, <em>Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio</em>. At least it is if the scarcity of hands raised in the audience when we were asked tonight is anything to go by. Yet, in East Asia these tales seem to hold much the same renown as those of the Brothers Grimm. <em>Strange Tales</em> is an adaptation for the Scottish stage of eight of these tales from Pauline Lockhart and Grid Iron's Co-Artistic Director, Ben Harrison.</p><p>Lockhart is accompanied on stage by Luna Dai and Robin Khor Yong Kuan, and the atmosphere in the theatre is similar to one you might find around a campfire. There seems to be a breeze or a chill in the air, or maybe, it's just my imagination, as the scene is set to that of a cold, snowy night. The tales and the performance are of the supernatural, of ghouls and demons, and fox spirits, and tiny people that live in your pupil. Strange is certainly an apt description for these tales. It all seems more than improbable, and yet, you're inclined to keep reason at bay. </p><p>The performance and tales are beautiful, magical and slightly terrifying. Then there are moments of humour and laughter. These I found to be of varying degrees of success. Mostly, they were moments of light-heartedness, social satire, or wit; however, as the tales keep you straddling precariously the edges of reality and absurdity, at times the laughter fell into ones of incredulity, shattering your suspended belief to that of illusion. Often, this was because it felt as though the stories were being comandeered by a Scot!</p><p>Yes, you've got that right - the tales had ghosts and goddesses in; yet, what I found to be too far a stretch for my imagination was a character from Paisley... Whilst I can appreciate this was perhaps done to make the tales more appealing, accessible or relevant to a Scottish audience; to me, these links felt more like a gaudy neon sign highlighting the similarities of these two cultures. </p><p>Maybe it's because I'm not Scottish, but nor am I East Asian. Simply put, it felt patronising and unnecessary. Though the mythology of the tales may not be ones we're familiar with, the themes of impatience, pride, foolishness, prejudice, and, of course, love are. All of these are universally understandable, regardless of whether you're from Shetland or Shanghai. </p><p>The performance overall remained cleverly done, and did more than succeed in persuading me to read Pu Songling's other 492 tales. It felt befitting to watch in the run up to Christmas, as even though it may not seem typically festive, I'd say hearing tales of morality, ghosts, magic and snow is pretty seasonal - it sure makes a nice change from watching <em>The Muppet Christmas Carol</em> again! </p><p><em>Strange Tales runs at the Traverse Theatre until 21 December 2019. </em></p>",

      "title": "Paula Rego: Obedience and Defiance Review",
      "html": "<p>IMAGE: 'TWO WOMEN BEING STONED' (1995)</p><p><strong><em>KIRSTEN, ON THE ARTISTIC CONTENT</em></strong></p><p><em>Obedience and Defiance</em> effectively, truthfully and at moments painfully, animalistic and brutally, yet always sophistically, re-tells the narrative of lived experiences that define, through expressionistic gestures, the very meaning of humanity. Paula Rego has autobiographically ensembled cut-ups, collages, etches, prints, oil paints, acrylic paints and oil pastels, that are exhibited in the curation for the viewer. The exhibition encapsulates messages of, coded in parts, explicit in other, folk and fairy tales that appeal to adults and children alike. Rego, and the curation of the exhibition itself, touches upon figures and the nuances within regimes, including female genital mutilation and abortion, universal pictures of violence that at moments can reveal themselves as very personal as the reality of women in the physical world as opposed to idealised female type. </p><p>Rego’s use of oil pastel, depicted in the figure of a woman who fills the frame of 'Lush' (1994) explicitly addresses the layering of physical human lives and corporality that are noticeable in her retellings of personal narratives as well as folklore. However, her use oil pastel becomes so harmonious that it is often mistakable for oil paint as colours, lines, figures and forms emerge and re-emerge, navigating their own space on the surface and within the room, often unknown as to why, even by Rego herself. The continuity of her work eagers the viewers anticipation, consisting of overheard conversations, political risks and triumphant experimentations within mediums, each as successful as the next. We believe all that Rego says in this exhibition, we trust with her the characters she displays and the references coherent throughout. </p><p>‘The resolve to survive, the defiance’, Paula Rego, her approach to life and art.</p><p><strong><em>JELENA, ON THE SOCIOPOLITICAL CONTEXT </em></strong></p><p>Rego’s works reflect her own observations and overarching political climate. Interestingly, she tends to focus employ media thematically; her female genital mutilation (FGM) series (2008) is predominantly composed of etchings, her <em>Dog Women</em> (1994) and abortion series stunning pastel paintings. Overarchingly, the artist enjoys exploring ‘power games and hierarchies’, often inverting power structures. ‘Joseph’s Dream’ (1990), for instance, features the Virgin Mary in the traditionally male role of the painter as understood by Rego, pushing and thrusting paint on to the canvas.</p><p>Rego’s own emotional ambivalence pervades the art. Women are portrayed as either, or simultaneously, strong and submissive, prevalent in the striking pastel ‘Two Women Being Stoned’ (1995) and corresponding study (1990). Through the <em>Girl and Dog</em> series, Rego employs the imagery of master-animal dependency to explore her complex feelings towards her ill husband, painter Victor Willing. Rego’s storytelling triptychs are her largest works, her interpretations of existing written and visual tales. ‘The Cell’ (1997) is one such adaptation of the Portuguese text <em>The Crime of Father Amaro </em>(1875), in which the young priest is graphically depicted in sexual fantasy about the Virgin Mary, represented by a small doll beneath his bed.</p><p>In the final room of the exhibition screens Nick Willing’s (Rego’s son) 90-minute documentary <em>Paula Rego: Secrets and Stories</em>. This deep exploration uncovers Rego’s personal and financial difficulties, periods of artistic drought (1966-1979), and great success, focusing upon the 1987 Serpentine Show in Hyde Park. Her ambivalent familial role is further unraveled, through the personal letter of her dying husband, and the artist’s undisplayed paintings ‘The Family’ and ‘Departure’ (1986). Particularly evocative were the artist’s candid discussions of her lifelong struggle with depression; Rego herself reveals some previously unseen works from 2007, hidden away for the artist’s own shame. Combining biography and artistic discussion in its compelling narrative, Willing’s film is compulsory viewing for any Rego enthusiast.</p><p>Rego herself is an ambivalent artist. She moves between media and themes, sometimes detailing precise studies, and at other times working straight on the paper. Despite her own reserved nature, Rego’s works are nevertheless loud expressions that demand to be heard.</p><p><em>Paula Rego: Obedience and Defiance runs at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art until 19 April 2020.</em></p><p><strong>REVIEW BY KIRSTEN SINCLAIR AND JELENA SOFRONIJEVIC</strong>. </p><p><strong>TUNE IN TO THE ARTS SHOW (TUESDAY 03 DECEMBER 2019) FOR AN EXCLUSIVE FEATURE RECORDED AT THE EXHIBITION WITH ALICE STRANG, SENIOR CURATOR AT THE NATIONAL GALLERIES OF SCOTLAND. </strong></p>",

      "html": "<p>Let’s face it - the trailer was awful. My childhood memories of Jamie Lee Curtis’ mom character in <em>Freaky Friday </em>(sorry film aficionados, that’s where I know her from) were threatened. I was tense. Anxious. Was I about to see Tess Coleman in….a bad movie??</p><p>Rest assured, (and all credence to all of the other Hollywood stalwarts, of which, there’s a long list), the film is….awesome. Genuinely entertaining, a clever and complex plot, and well-rendered characters make <em>Knives Out </em>a joy to watch. </p><p>I was worried that the lone puzzle-solver, the peerless sleuth trope was overdone, but it seems to have survived another round in Daniel Craig’s character Detective Benoit Blanc. The detective, who, despite the very obviously French name, has a never-explained but very charismatic southern drawl is hired to investigate the death of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer).</p><p>The Thrombey dynasty, it is revealed is immense, and as with every large estate, the question of the will, who’s in and who’s out brings out the worst of the Thrombey’s. The in-fighting brings out some interesting social commentary that cuts alongside the plot, especially when the film’s heroine Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) has her ethnicity “mis-remembered” a dozen times by the family, and there’s everyone from an Instagram influencer mom (Toni Collette) to a worryingly mobilised and alt-right teen-turned-troll (Jaeden Martell).</p><p>The best bit about the film, is how it manages to maintain many of the old mainstays of a whodunit and makes use of them, as if for the first time. The clues are cleverly placed and unravelled, and there’s a sense of freshness that’s difficult to bring to this genre. With such a large cast including Chris Evans, Noah Segan, Michael Shannon, and Katherine Langford, it is inevitable that some of the characters get a bit lost along the way as the plot zooms into its thrilling conclusion. Nonetheless, there are enough twists and turns to keep everyone satisfied.</p><p><em>Knives Out is in cinemas now.</em></p><p><em>Reviewed as Film of the Week, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CameoCinema/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAKPislawMGrxiIlOlKYIP0GVXzfAUHgmBMjXHmpalXq5DqZ0ekPOKWkVhdpl0anMOypoM_ffelobqg&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3m5rVwBfwOJBI9lTeXSVSV4IYSi-mkvNZrxLjX3sf9xQMBIfwQHqmnOVhTFYMde1OP-K_JXHjoyELZdbrRqQDXdlHV7H5DG6KX3FTQ1Fzhb3w-GoG7ijjb_l1NfYC7DJv3itREpuLqx53UleCbHFCPh1eylwt12_xPafkq3MvN_UySxZGvJea5I8ZySnFlrWmbaCut5-8BkE3Ga1Ro4DBM_S-mnuCuqcAOjZTcwpJqLTYt5CiI89TWL2qeKxQIcA6kU0MUg_evAWOWlP6z0X2xgsM-IjI0zCr9irfz-vyW5yJGaFEwKoHbNAOIRGXXX4EEs4yA24RniNW96daiVU\">Cameo Cinema</a>, Edinburgh.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>\"Not everything is good right now in the world but there's always something to be happy about\" are the words echoed around  Óran Mór as Ezra Collective drummer, Femi Koleoso, addresses the crowd before descending into the last song, 'São Paolo'. The fully packed Glasgow basement erupted into movement and there wasnt a single soul stood still. But this was not the only time of the night you could feel like something was really beginning to happen, that the freedom so often associated with jazz was being revived. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/2019/11/1500-1519719974-2.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Ezra Collective, 2018&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Stepping foot into Óran Mór, a basement venue just out of the city, the energetic joy Ezra Collective being wherever they step was present long before they started playing. The London jazz ensemble, made up of Femi Koleoso on drums, TJ Koleoso on bass, Dylan Jones on trumpet, James Mollison on saxophone and Joe Armon-Jones on keys, are by no means new to the world of music but this performance captured the joy of playing for an audience for the first time. There was the sense they were experiencing this for the first time, along with the audience; a band genuinely grateful for the audience they've acquired over the last seven years and a band wholly connected to the spontaneous spirit of jazz. </p><p>The band opened with their well known tracks 'The Philosopher' and 'Colonial Mentality', before stopping to light an incense stick on Armon-Jones' keyboard, a small detail but one which connected the players and the audience. It's clear that Ezra Collective not only work well as musicians but also as people; their love for one another infused the performance with a level of energy difficult to acquire in jazz currently. However the band are proud of the music they play and its roots in jazz, stopping to pay homage to the great Sun Ra with 'Space is the Place'. They also acknowledge their afrobeat influences, tributing Femi Kuti's 'Water No Enemy', and adding their own distinctive style on top of that, a lot of which comes from the genuine connection between the players. This was all before introducing a cover, inspired by the newly released 'Joker' film, of Charlie Chaplin's composition 'Smile'. Ezra Collective look back to great performers, seemingly failing to acknowledge they are ones themselves and it's their humble nature which adds to the beauty of the performance. </p><p>As well as paying tribute to their musical influences, Ezra Collective emphasise the importance of Glasgow as a city for music lovers. Femi Koleoso gave an emotional speech about the difficulties of making it in the jazz world as a working-class troupe of young Londoners and then again, the trials which come with making jazz feel accessible to a wide demographic. The audience were silent as the band discussed the joy they felt being in Glasgow, the first place they played outside a jazz club and the energy that had bought. Now, years on that energy still exists and the band were full of gratitude for an audience still as full of life as they are. Every gig in Glasgow seems to be filled with people who have such a love for music as well as each other, and combined with the undeniable talent that Ezra Collective bring it was no surprise the crowd let loose during the final song, 'São Paolo', the track which had \"blown the roof\" (Koleoso) off Glasgow when it was first played live years previously. </p>",

      "html": "<p>The United Kingdom, 1988. Thatcher becomes the longest serving British Prime Minister. Core industries are privatised in succession. Section 28 of the Local Government Act prohibits schools from ‘the teaching of the acceptability of homosexuality’. And Conservative junior minister, Robin Hesketh, and his wife, Diana, exchange verbal spears in their Oxfordshire country home.</p><p>Simon Woods’ script is sheer perfection, gradually narrowing its focus from the overarching political landscape to its implications upon the couple, to an emotionally shattering conclusion. The story is expertly evoked by Alex Jennings and Lindsay Duncan. Duncan’s Diana eloquently hurls gin-soaked slurs at her husband, ironically craving the release of death whilst the less fortunate are dying in NHS hospital queues. Her barbs towards Conservative policies and party members are hilariously scathing, though she bears just as much resentment towards ‘the insatiable desire of the people of this country to be f*cked by an old Etonian’.</p><p>Not to be outshone, Jennings’ responses are equally provocative. Diana’s leftism is countered by his remarks of the privileged stance of us critical theatre-goers and book-readers – ignorant to the realities of policy making. His resonant declaration that the Conservatives will continue to retain power so long as Labour selects poor leaders is not lost on the audience.</p><p>The National Theatre Live recorded format does well to showcase the entirety of the tonal set. No detail is spared, from the cream AGA range, to the perfect Conservative-blue of their child’s Sports Day rosette – a bitter final touch reinforcing the personal effects of Tory policies on the marginalised. It’s immaculate, though I wouldn’t expect anything less.</p><p>In this moment, when political identification and policies are again emotionally charged, and we’ve all-too-easily mistaken an ‘expensive education for an actual understanding of the world’, <em>Hansard </em>is a necessary reminder that our legacies are always being recorded.</p><p><em>Hansard was screened at the Festival Theatre on 22 November 2019 as part of National Theatre Live’s 10<sup>th</sup> Birthday Season.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>There was a sort of frenetic energy at the Bedlam Theatre. Though usually full and friendly, the crowd was out in force, with cheers and whoops as the names of performers, producers, and directors were read aloud. Now that’s the kind of support we could all do with.</p><p>A total of six theatrical shorts were showcased, covering all thematic ends of the spectrum - from a bizzarist 'Brexit: The Musical' short (A Musical about Brexit by Lara Stone), to a poignant nod to Me Too (Me Too by Molly Keating). Many touched on the political, of which, the agendas were clear: the audience are to laugh, or to think.</p><p>Two of the six, Stone’s Brexit short and Rebecca Maxwell’s 'John and Steven' performances made for genuinely delightful viewing, funny in the right places and making its satire just overt enough. The stage presence too of the actors were great to watch. John and Steven’s almost tennis-like back and forth on the topic of women (perhaps deliberately <em>without</em> any women ever on stage to chime in with their opinion on the matter), was well-written, and genuinely funny. The best short, however, I must give to Lara Stone’s Brexit Musical, a fantastically tight script and exceptionally good rendering of the cast, it was well brought to life by the performers.</p><p>Sadly, for me, the remaining four shorts missed the mark. Two especially, were difficult to follow and unsatisfying ('Family Dinner' by Zoe Robertson, and 'Nothing Ever Changes' by Amy Yeo), where the former’s demonic and very shout-y ending was sadly a turn-off, and the latter seemed to spend a lot of time on not very much at all.</p><p>The two other features, 'The Reassessment' by Benjamin Wolff, and 'Me Too' by Molly Keating, <em>should </em>have been great. Though sadly, the characters of the first were too grating and annoying to make the very important point about cruel and de-humanising welfare 'assessments'. These characters were the assessors which does make the point, but the writing felt one-dimensional, and missed out on focusing on the performance’s most important character: the individual whose financial security rests in the uncaring assessors’ hands. 'Me Too' should be commended for its difficult subject matter, and the three different items of clothing (a blazer, a dressing gown, and a denim jacket) were clever props to illustrate how sexism, and sexual abuse can occur at any point, and any age. </p><p><em>The Edinburgh University Theatre Company’s (EUTC) Candlewasters Showcase was performed at the Bedlam Theatre on 22 November 2019. </em></p>",

      "html": "<p>It’s the 1970s in London’s East End, and Mike, Les, and Sylv live lives embroiled in sex, violence, and boredom. Almost forty-five years after its Edinburgh Fringe debut, these young upstarts are revived in ECA’s Wee Red Bar, a perfectly intimate setting for this dark tale.</p><p>Steven Berkoff’s script<em> </em>– fully titled <em>Elegy for the East End and its Energetic Waste </em>– is not for the faint-hearted. The combination of vulgar London slang and verse with Shakespearean, Falstaff-esque dialogue, often make for uncomfortable viewing. Mike and Sylv’s explicit encounter sees the two languages meld together into dark seduction, though ultimately ending with a ‘zip up’ and move on. The dialogue frequently spirals into outright racism, anti-Semitism, and misogyny. In the case of the latter, the controversial content is salvaged by the production’s female cast members. Scarlett Stitt shines as Sylv, particularly in her ‘I’d like to be a fella!’ monologue, problematising the care-free, often juvenile attitude to sex and life of the men around her. Equally, Ishbel McLachlan’s Mum is a comical, though unfortunate, figure, condemned to a restricted home life and gassy husband. McLachlan’s impeccable comic timing ramps up Mum’s unexpected sexual encounters in the cinema to sheer hilarity.</p><p>Stark black outs between the episodes are smoothly transitioned by nimble-fingered Eve Simpson on the piano, which lend the production a charming rag-time character. Accompanied by Sylv and Mike’s near-robotically portrayed ‘love story’, these quirky transitions only add to the production’s often absurd character. The five-strong cast excel in their physicality. Occasionally, they burst into traditional London East End verse, performed with strained face at deafening volume. The final rendition of ‘Daisy Daisy’ is near haunting.</p><p><em>East</em>’s content is difficult – whether for the viewer, or the performer. Nevertheless, the cast of the Edinburgh University Shakespeare Company certainly rise to the challenge.</p><p><em>East runs at the Wee Red Bar until 21 November 2019. </em></p>",

      "html": "<p>I know 3pm is a wee bit too early to be thinking of whisky, but Adam Park's beautiful documentary has me looking forward to a dram. His new documentary, funded partly through kickstarter, made its debut in January 2019 and was subsequently nominated for Best Documentary Feature Film at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. Not without reason, <em>The Amber Light</em> features all things inherent to Scottish culture and how these have been hued in the colours of its beloved national drink. </p><p>A collaboration between renowned Glaswegian spirits writer Dave Broom and online food &amp; drinks magazine The Gannet, the film takes us past various famed whisky-locations and distilleries, and allows us to meet the distillers, writers, musicians, artists and like-minded filmmakers who are all bound together through a shared love of scotch(land). While we travel with Dave Broom from Glasgow to remote Islay, Elgin, Fife and Edinburgh we learn more of the history of whisky and its status in Scotland. The different roles whisky has played within the communities throughout Scotland and that its taste quite literally reflects the land on which it is made. Treasured by many, the taste of whisky comes alive in the regions in which it is born, its smell awakens memories of family and community in many a Scotsman. </p><p>The intricate chemistry of whisky distilling is brought back to its roots and origins: the pursuit of <em>uisge beathe </em>or aqua vitae. With a few modest ingredients, clear running water, a (preferably hidden) distilling apparatus and a lot of patience, anyone can set up their own whisky supply. To be drank at ceilidh's, shared with your neighbours or gifted to a beloved friend. Whisky culture is above all a human culture, musicians, chefs and even renown crime thriller writer Ian Rankin share their personal histories, memories, and relationships with whisky. Together with the beautiful photography shot by Dan Dennison and Dulani Wilson's storyboard animations, the bright vibrant colours paint a cheerful yet serene picture of overall Scottish culture. </p><p>The Amber Light shows that Scotch is (and has always been) a cultural product, part of a ‘cultural terroir’. If you're feeling homesick for your roots by now, why not order a 'local barley juice' at your local pub tonight?</p><p><em><em>The </em>Amber Light<em> is in cinemas now</em>. Cameo have a special screening on 25 November 2019, including a Q&amp;A with the director and a whisky-tasting. </em></p><p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Reviewed as Film of the Week, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CameoCinema/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAKPislawMGrxiIlOlKYIP0GVXzfAUHgmBMjXHmpalXq5DqZ0ekPOKWkVhdpl0anMOypoM_ffelobqg&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3m5rVwBfwOJBI9lTeXSVSV4IYSi-mkvNZrxLjX3sf9xQMBIfwQHqmnOVhTFYMde1OP-K_JXHjoyELZdbrRqQDXdlHV7H5DG6KX3FTQ1Fzhb3w-GoG7ijjb_l1NfYC7DJv3itREpuLqx53UleCbHFCPh1eylwt12_xPafkq3MvN_UySxZGvJea5I8ZySnFlrWmbaCut5-8BkE3Ga1Ro4DBM_S-mnuCuqcAOjZTcwpJqLTYt5CiI89TWL2qeKxQIcA6kU0MUg_evAWOWlP6z0X2xgsM-IjI0zCr9irfz-vyW5yJGaFEwKoHbNAOIRGXXX4EEs4yA24RniNW96daiVU\">Cameo Cinema</a>, Edinburgh</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em>.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></p>",

      "html": "<p><em>Beneath The Surface</em> features the artists Sara Brennan, Micheal Craik, Eric Cruikshank, Kenneth Dingwall, Callum Innes, Alan Johnston, James Lumsden, Karlyn Sutherland, Andrea Walsh. </p><p>The show starts with Kenneth Dingwall’s piece ‘presence’ and presence it has. It uses basswood that resembles an opening cocoon, creating a sense of looming modernity and its clash with nature. The natural elements of the exhibition are only further highlighted by the work of Sara Brennan. Her series of tapestries mimic the planes of natural forms such as horizons, utilising the form of weaving. Not only does this give her work dimensional depth but the use of a Scottish craft highlights the importance of exploring Scottish abstract art as its own entity.</p><p>Clearly the Scottish landscape is an important point of inspiration for contemporary artists as can be seen in Callum Innes’s use of the natural colour tones and minerals in his ‘exposed painting’ with charcoal and red oxide. Innes carefully evokes the rusty reds and black of Scottish wildlife while retain the minimalism and ambiguous form associated with abstract art. </p><p>Traditional craft is also another point of inspiration from Scottish culture. Both by Brennan in her use of weaving, and also in Andrea Walsh’s work which uses traditional glassmaking and metal working techniques. These materials also interact with the natural light of the room, which is particularly noticeable as the curator decided to place one of Karlyn Sutherland’s glass pieces behind it. This decision exposes the trend in the exhibition of exploring light. Representations of window-like forms can be seen throughout as a means to explore perspective. Both Sutherland’s ‘light study, Toyama (4)’ and Craik’s ‘Vestige 44’ and ‘45’ manage to evoke the movement and light of a window with very little except aluminium and coloured paint. </p><p>Two more standout pieces also mimic the image of a window; Johnston’s ‘untitled’ wall drawing and his acrylic and graphite pencil on linen. These naturally question the nature of perspective, drawing the overarching theme of viewing into a nice ring. </p><p>Clearly the curation was carefully executed, and the works chosen carefully complement each other and the themes of the show. I found that although the exhibition brought interesting ideas to the foreground, some of the pieces became slightly repetitive. The show is enjoyable but not necessarily ground-breaking or shocking. It is refreshing however, to see an abstract show made up completely of Scottish-based artists working with Scottish materials and themes. Particularly because historically, abstract artists from Scotland relocated to either London or Europe. The exhibition exposes the contemporary Scottish abstract that until now, had been sitting beneath the surface. </p><p><em>'Beneath the Surface' runs at the City Art Centre until 1 March 2020. </em></p>",

      "html": "<p>Only knowing a vague plot, with a forgotten film somewhere buried in my mind, I was curious to see how a melange of fairytales ties in with the Edinburgh University Savoy Opera Group's fall musical, or otherwise called November show. With a cast of no less than seventeen members, not including the twelve musicians with Richard Blaquière as their Musical Director, the directing team had a daunting task ahead of them. </p><p>The 1986 original musical by the same time, was a collaborative work by Stephen Sondheim (music and lyrics) and James Lapine (story). The work can be seen as a compromise - Sondheim wanted to write a 'quest' musical whereas Lapine had the desire to write a fairytale. The result ends up being a mashup of the plots of several Brothers Grimm and Charles Perrault fairy tales, which through their intertwined explore the consequances of the characters' wishes and quests. It is this interesting layer of dynamic between what is the right thing to do, deconstructing the classical fairytale endings and looking further than the original finale of the tales, where the musical's magic really lies. </p><p>Our main characters are formed through the baker (Rob Merriam) and his wife (Julia Weingaertner) who desperately want a son. Their neighbouring witch (Lori Flannigan) tasks them with the retrieval of four items, which brings our loving (sometimes fighting) couple to a young and innocent Jack from Jack and the Beanstalk (Gordon Stackhouse), a naive Cinderella (Jess Butcher), a sassy Little Red Ridinghood (Maya Sargent) and a rebellious but lonely Rapunzel (Livi Wollaston). As any good fairytale, we have Rory McKeon as narrator, since \"there always has to be one left to tell the tale\". With his beautifully crafted cut out books, mingling in the storyline and sometimes even holding up the story temporarily (to the annoyance of the other characters), he guides the audience in a humurous way into the realm of the fairytale.</p><p>The amazing singing talents of in particular Julia Weingaertner (the baker's wife) and Livi Wollaston (Rapunzel), together with an absolutely stunning performance of Lori Flannigan (the Witch), who frankly still scares me, turn the average student show into a Broadway worthy musical. The humurous and modern exchanges, together with a great costume design turn this humble reproduction of the wellknown and -loved 1986 musical into a cherished modernised experience. From Mr. Charming (Ewan Bruce)  and Mr. Handsome (Rory Bayliss-Chalmers) - according to their saches - attempt to step in each others' spotlight and ridiculise the traditional conduct and gait of the 'Prince', to the Witch's (Lori Flannigan) humanization and tender and emotional \"Witch's Lament\" (Children can only grow, from something you love to something you lose), <em>Into the Woods</em> makes us reconsider the traditional roles we have forced our fairytale characters in. With the tale and songs still echoing through my mind and in the Pleasance Theatre for three days to come, if I cannot encourage you enough to go maybe they will: \"Into the Woods [...] I know [you] have to take the journey!\". </p><p><em>Into the Woods runs at the Pleasance Theatre until 23 November 2019.</em></p><p></p>",

      "html": "<p>Ian Rankin: famed Scottish writer (now-Edinburgh local), kingpin of crime fiction, creator and mastermind of the world-renowned Inspector Rebus series, and wonderful conversationalist and interviewee.</p><p>I had a very enjoyable time, from being whisked into the room by attentive ushers, directed immediately to a glass of wine, and offered a choice of any open seat in the house. The lighting was good, the guest was great, and the hosts, and their questions (and those of the audience), were sharp and insightful.</p><p>With convivial banter and chat, Rankin discussed his childhood and the origin of his relationship with literature, which grew out of time spent reading book upon book to escape the slow-moving and “stifling” village of Cardenden; the happenstance of his becoming a crime fiction writer (his first, still-unpublished, book was a comedy; the money was much better writing crime fiction novels); his characters, which he seems to live alongside, spending time with them or having conversations with them about how the current book should play out- Inspector Rebus is inspired by Rankin’s own life and is often utilized as a therapeutic instrument in dealing with certain experiences (e.g. growing old, having children), but Rankin testifies that many of the other characters are imbued with his personality as well, re: Rebus’s arch-nemesis ‘Big-Ger’ Cafferty.</p><p>Ian also explained how he writes his novels, which is remarkably similar to how many students write, whether they do by choice or wish that they didn’t: wait until the pressure builds up and the deadlines close in. Begin without an end in sight, or in mind. Bang out a first (or final) draft under these intense conditions, then hand over to your wife (or partner, or trusted friend) for editing.</p><p><em>This event was hosted at the Lyceum Rehearsal Room on 19 November 2019 by Lung Ha, Scotland’s leading theatre company working with people with learning disabilities.

      "html": "<p>Boston Manor made their come back to Edinburgh on the 13th of November and Andrzej Caba was there to spectate the pop punk chaos.</p><p>It is Wednesday evening and even though it may seem like attendance should not be too big, La Belle Angèle is packed and the reason for that becomes clear, the second the band hits the stage. However, before that happens, there are supporting acts giving everything they have to set up the mood for the evening.</p><p>Right after the doors open a Brighton trio called Gender Roles make their Edinburgh debut. They sound like an indie-punk equivalent of Crywank and even though hearts of everyone in the venue went to the headliner, it was them who stole mine. Right after them, Modern Error take over and in a surprising, yet fitting way swift the mood by delivering metalcore carnage in vein of Parkway Drive and August Burns Red.</p><p>It is almost 9PM and the crowd is starting to gather closer and closer to the stage. Out of the darkness, five figures appear and they are welcomed really enthusiastically. They open the show with <em>Liquid</em> and it is obvious why the venue is full despite the fact that it is Wednesday. In a split second everybody rushes forward. The incredibly strong bond between the band and the fans is  undeniable. It is impossible to spot somebody at the front who is not screaming all the lyrics at the top of their lungs. One could think it only happens because the band is playing one of their biggest hits, but it occurs on every song. This phenomena of unity is indisputable in the punk scene and Boston Manor are there to carry this torch for many years to come.</p><p>As crazy as it sound, they are still a modern pop punk band at heart. Even during a live performance, their sound is very clear and polished. All the band members are jumping all around the stage, but they are able to keep a very tight performance and hence provide a powerful and extremely energetic show. The singer Henry Cox is the link between what is happening in the crowd and on the stage. Even though he is not jumping the barricade like for example Jeremy Bolm of Touché Amoré, he still does a very good job in linking the fans and the band. Between the songs, he makes fun conversation with the audience, while everyone takes a break from ripping through the setlist at over 100% power.</p><p>The setlist, which is clearly thought out and organized so the singalong anthems at mid tempo are mixed with more powerful and faster songs. The concert reaches the peak intensity when Boston Manor play <em>Laika </em>and the sense of community gets even stronger than before. Before the band continues with the final song, Henry explains that there will not be any encores because they ”are not f***ing Guns N Roses” and promises to come back very soon. They play <em>Halo</em> and everyone in the venue gives their last bits of energy. As the concert ends, everybody is tired but very clearly satisfied, because they have just experienced a truly thrilling experience at the pop punk funhouse with Boston Manor.</p><p><br></p><p>Setlist:</p><p>Liquid</p><p>Lead Feet</p><p>England’s Dreaming</p><p>Funeral Party</p><p>Flowers</p><p>Digital Ghost</p><p>Bad Machine</p><p>FY1 - Stick Up</p><p>Burn You Up</p><p>Tunnel Vision</p><p>Hate You</p><p>Laika</p><p>Halo</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rw85yLl0Rk8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>",

      "html": "<p><strong><em>MAISY, ON THE VENUE</em></strong></p><p>Walking into LeithLate's Moon Party, we were met with free UV paint, adhesive diamantés, and temporary tattoos. Of course, we'd come ready prepared with glitter under our eyes, but that didn't stop us heading straight for the decoration station. Within moments, we and all the other guests were transformed, ethereal creatures of the night, ready for whatever the enigmatic Moon Party had to offer.</p><p>Walking in, we saw a smashed piano artfully discarded outside the front door. Indeed, The Moon Party marked the beginning of Leith Theatre's installation of the Pianodrome, a fully functional and even playable art piece comprising a circular spectator stand made from upcycled pianos. Keys, strings, pedals and all were reconstructed into the audience's seats for the evening, our vantage point for the series of spine-tingling performances taking place in the middle of the circle. Live music, an LED circus act and a transcendent DJ carried us through the evening and into the early hours. Set within the chilly walls of Leith Theatre, a church-come-performance space, the Moon Party was nothing short of bizarre: both everything and nothing we expected.</p><p><strong><em>JELENA, ON LIZABETT RUSSO AND GRAEME STEPHEN</em></strong></p><p>Ethereal singer Lizabett Russo began the evening, weaving layers of harmonised vocals into spooky melodies with deft use of her loop pedal. Russo was accompanied by Graeme Stephen on guitar, who performed his live score to <em>Nosferatu</em> in Leith last Halloween. Equally as enticing were Russo’s personal stories; describing her childhood in Transylvania, she swished her fitted Victorian black coat, comparing it with a vampire’s cape. The two Leith locals were a perfectly spooky duo, capable of entrancing any listener.</p><p><strong><em>REUBEN, ON THE CHRIS LYONS GYPSY JAZZ QUINTET</em></strong></p><p>Liz, you were great, honestly, but not sure if you got the memo -- it’s a moon PARTY. Cue the Chris Lyons Gypsy Jazz Quintet to the Pianodrome’s elliptical epicentre, armed with guitars, trumpet, mandolin, double bass and fiddle. Microphones?, the band scoffed, who needs ‘em -- we’re going acoustic. Sip slowly on your mulled punch and whisky -- every second of the syncopated swing and funkalicious folk is to be savoured. The Pianodrome transformed from an enclosure of bewitching intimacy into a starry, smiling speakeasy as the talent quintet propelled us along the beginning of our late night lunar ascent.</p><p><strong><em>RORY, ON THINK CIRCUS AND DJ JOSEPH MALIK</em></strong></p><p>As decadence set in, the classical hall of Leith Theatre began to house an event increasingly distant from the night’s ethereal beginnings. Think Circus brought along two performers, who presented a display of light and movement nothing short of mesmerising. Entirely captivated, the audience looked on as the couple span round the room encircled by flashing lights, while esteemed DJ Joseph Malik provided the bassy audial backdrop. The two performers eventually left the Pianodrome, leaving the space open for Malik to command a dancefloor with his mix of jazzy and techno tunes as the audience, hours ago sat serenely in awe of Russo and Stephen, flooded centre stage in a riotous party.</p><p><em>Leith Late 19: Moon Party performed on 16 November 2019. </em></p><p><em>For more information on upcoming events, visit <a href=\"https://www.leithlate.co.uk/\">leithlate.co.uk/</a>. </em></p><p><strong>REVIEW BY MAISY HALLAM, REUBEN FOX McCLURE, RORY BIGGS, AND JELENA SOFRONIJEVIC, AS A FRESHAIR ARTS x THE CULTURE SECTION: <a href=\"https://www.studentnewspaper.org/\">THE STUDENT</a> COLLABORATION. </strong></p>",

      "html": "<p>Coventry indie post-punk rockers FEET made their headlining Edinburgh debut on the 7th of November at the Mash House and Andrzej Caba was there to witness all hell break loose.</p><p>Thursday night is not necessarily a perfect date for a concert, so it was surprising to see the venue being pretty full for this show, yet at the same time it felt like Friday night would probably sell out. However, those who decided to come were in for a treat since the first minutes. Both opening bands Medicine Cabinet and The Van T’s provided energetic and fun performances which set up the mood for the evening. Even though they were pretty loud, it felt like calm before the storm once FEET came out.</p><p>It is 9PM and five guys who look like they all just got out of a time machine from a different period in the past century go out on stage. Each of them clearly living in their own world while performing from the very first note, dancing and moving like possessed. They start with one of the most energetic tracks of their full-length debut - <em>English</em> <em>Weather</em> - and then jump right into one of the most dancy tunes - <em>Axeman</em>.</p><p>FEET’s sound is hard to pin point. They have been compared to Blur or Pulp, as well as to Parquet Courts. According to the band, they have no interest in the first two and take much more from Frank Zappa and other 60’s and 70’s acts. Those vibes definitely take over the stage when the band is performing. Especially songs like <em>What’s Inside Is More Than Just Ham</em> where the performance is much noisier and incorporates a lot of jamming when compared to the album version.</p><p>As the songs progress, you can feel the bond between the band and the audience get stronger and stronger. The musicians are going more and more crazy and so is the audience. The setlist is very well balanced. Catchy and easy-on-ears songs are mixed with those which are loud and slightly experimental. At the same time some kind of tension is building so the show gets more and more all-out and energetic. By the last song, the mosh pit is spread across better part of the room and everyone is giving all they have. FEET finish with the punkiest and the fastest sing they have - <em>Outer</em> <em>Rim</em> and the show reached peak intensity that could be compared to IDLES.</p><p>In a concert setting FEET are a force of nature. They have weird, magical chemistry between them that is not so commonly met. The kind of chemistry like the already mentioned IDLES or Daughters, where every member is doing their own thing and it all connects into incredibly tight and dynamic performance. This Thursday night at the Mash House is something everyone who was there will remember for a long time and those who were not there to witness it should really regret it.</p><p>Setlist:</p><p>English Weather</p><p>Axeman</p><p>Chalet 47</p><p>What’s Inside Is More Than Just Ham</p><p>Wiggy Pop</p><p>Dog Walking</p><p>Good Richard’s Crash Landing</p><p>Ad Blue</p><p>Petty Thieving</p><p>Outer Rim</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D80be8yCj7I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>",

      "html": "<p>It’s no secret that <em>Fleabag</em> is huge. Quite literally. Projected on to the wide Festival Theatre screen, writer and actor Phoebe Waller-Bridge physically dominates the stage.</p><p>National Theatre Live streams live British (predominantly London-based) theatre to cinema and theatre screens internationally. Over the last ten years, their screenings have reached over nine million people in 2500 cinemas and 65 countries. Aware of the exclusive nature of theatre, I’m a strong supporter of this initiative. Indeed, Waller-Bridge sparked mania after announcing that she would be performing her one woman show for the final time this autumn. And for those of us who aren’t London-based, or cannot fork out the £68 for tickets (nor the near-£600 resale), this is certainly the next best alternative. By offering concession tickets around £10, these screenings are bypassing - if not fully breaking - boundaries in access to theatre.</p><p>Projecting Waller-Bridge on the big screen, the minute details in her performance become amplified. Her theatrical physicality, and ability to inhabit multiple characters simultaneously and seamlessly, is dulled down for television. Here though, it shines. Her portrayals of her well-endowed mother, unable to see the floor for her large breasts, and the pursed-lip ‘Tube Rodent’ are hilarious. With Waller-Bridge conducting the entire performance from a single chair, <em>Fleabag</em>’s Edinburgh Fringe origins are welcomingly apparent.</p><p>Stripped back of other characters and setting, Fleabag’s emotional outpourings are afforded precious additional time and detail. Her soulless naked photography trips to the disabled toilets, and her closing confession of her own sexual obsession and isolation is haunting. ‘Either everyone feels like this a little bit, or they’re not talking about it, or I’m completely f*cking alone’ - Waller-Bridge’s desperate expression and awkward pauses heighten the unease.</p><p>Nevertheless, avid viewers of the television series would recognise the vast majority of the content. The performance is an eighty minute summary of the first series, featuring all of the main storylines,played out in much the same way. I wondered whether the (explicit) content might lose its shock impact. The sharp intakes of breath and stifled laughter from my fellow audience members in Edinburgh, and London’s Wyndham Theatre, tell me otherwise.</p><p>Whether you prefer the more complete television rendering, or the rawness of theatrical performance – or recognise them as separate entities – Waller-Bridge’s isolated monologue loudly sounds.</p><p><em>Fleabag was screened at the Festival Theatre on 15 November 2019 as part of National Theatre Live’s 10<sup>th</sup> Birthday Season.</em></p>",

      "title": "The Good Liar Review",
      "html": "<p>Intrigue, deception and violence is not what you expect from an all British film starring the nation's sweethearts Helen Mirren (76) and Ian McKellen (80). Following the rhythm of the elderly Betty McLeish (Helen Mirren) and Roy Courtnay (Ian McKellen), the film takes its time to explore the feelings and emotions they go through in their brief (platonic) courtship. McKellen takes his viewers and poor Betty hostage while he cunningly and conningly makes his way into Betty's home, heart, and of course her wallet. A recent window, Betty's only possessions are a “smothering in beige” (Roy Courtnay) house in the suburbs of London, a devoted grandson who specializes in WWII, and a savings account of around 2.6 million pounds. With only a few months more to live due to mini strokes, she makes the perfect candidate for Roy and his partner in crime Vincent to convince her to open up a joint account to better their investments – only to clear the account as soon as she hits the transfer button. Clearly director and producer Bill Condon and writer Jeffrey Hatcher cannot think it's audience that stupid to see where this is going?</p><p>From the soft soundtrack provided by Carter Burwell to the elegance with which the stellar couple dominate their spaces and London's High Street, I can only describe this film as British chic at its finest. As Roy rightfully remarks, they are both from the same different time – and they have never lost their sense of British flair. Or did they? While flashes of violence break through the chintzy cosiness of the film, the viewers start to see the cracks in both the webs the characters have woven for themselves now and through the years. <em>The Good Liar </em>seemingly spoils its own plot right in the beginning, but is the plot we are made to believable the actual plot of the film? Through overarching themes and twists, more and more of the truth is revealed. And when you finally reach that much needed end to all of your questions, you see how brilliantly Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen actually played their parts all along. Just as the two-folded title, <em>The Good Liar </em>has many layers if you know how to look between the lies. You are definitely in for a noir-ish slow-burn thrill ride.</p><p><em>The Good Liar is in cinemas now.</em></p><p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Reviewed as Film of the Week, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CameoCinema/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAKPislawMGrxiIlOlKYIP0GVXzfAUHgmBMjXHmpalXq5DqZ0ekPOKWkVhdpl0anMOypoM_ffelobqg&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3m5rVwBfwOJBI9lTeXSVSV4IYSi-mkvNZrxLjX3sf9xQMBIfwQHqmnOVhTFYMde1OP-K_JXHjoyELZdbrRqQDXdlHV7H5DG6KX3FTQ1Fzhb3w-GoG7ijjb_l1NfYC7DJv3itREpuLqx53UleCbHFCPh1eylwt12_xPafkq3MvN_UySxZGvJea5I8ZySnFlrWmbaCut5-8BkE3Ga1Ro4DBM_S-mnuCuqcAOjZTcwpJqLTYt5CiI89TWL2qeKxQIcA6kU0MUg_evAWOWlP6z0X2xgsM-IjI0zCr9irfz-vyW5yJGaFEwKoHbNAOIRGXXX4EEs4yA24RniNW96daiVU\">Cameo Cinema</a>, Edinburgh</em></em></em></em>.</em></em></em></em></p>",

      "title": "Scottish Opera: Tosca Review",
      "html": "<p>Declaring you’re spending the night at the opera can raise a few bemused eyebrows. ‘That’s very elegant’, ‘I didn’t think that was a thing people actually did’, were amongst my smiling responses. Opera’s reputation precedes it, but if anyone needs convincing that this is an art form that can resonate with any beating heart, I recommend taking a seat at Puccini’s <em>Tosca</em>, currently being staged at Edinburgh’s Festival Theatre.</p><p>Based on Victorien Sardou’s 1887 play <em>La Tosca</em>, Giacomo Puccini’s Italian opera follows the story of singer Floria Tosca and her lover, artist Mario Cavaradossi, at a time of political unrest in Italy. After Cavaradossi is arrested for offering aid to an escaped political prisoner, the corrupt and lecherous Chief of Police Baron Scarpia offers Tosca a choice: surrender to his desire or accept the execution of her lover.</p><p>The plot promises tension, but it’s when the first trembling notes of the orchestra are heard that the power of Puccini’s score to pierce souls is felt. Anthony Besch’s production of <em>Tosca</em>, first staged in 1980 and now somewhat of a modern classic, is revived here by Scottish Opera under direction of Jonathan Cocker. Besch’s reimagining of Puccini’s opera, set in 1800 during the Napoleonic Wars, in the Fascist setting of World War II Rome, is brought to life vividly on stage. From the monolithic architecture of the Catholic Church in Act I to the marrying of religious iconography with sinister officials in trench coats, the gaudy, chauvinistic ideology of Fascist Italy is evoked without the need for flags bearing fasces to flap in the background.</p><p>The effect is chilling. The brutality of the setting jars affectively with the soaring beauty of the operatic voices and their orchestral accompaniment. Conducted by Stuart Stratford, the orchestra sets the tone in every scene, from the pugnacity of the ensemble of Fascists and the Catholic congregation in Act I’s thunderous climax to the eerie stillness of Act III’s opening at the gallows. The orchestra takes the audience through the story - every twist, every turn, every emotion -allowing us to feel what’s happening so what is truly important is never lost in translation.</p><p>Then there are the voices. Cavaradossi, played by Gwyn Hughes Jones, moves from comedic commentary sung with an exasperated sigh when attempting to allay Tosca’s misplaced jealousy, to impassioned remembrance as he contemplates losing her. As the tenor calls out, it is moving to hear how a voice so radiant can nevertheless ache. Roland Wood as Scarpia, both in commanding stage presence and his bold, baritone vocal aptly conveys the baseness of his character. The voice that shoots straight for the soul, however, is Natalya Romaniw in the role of Tosca. An exquisite performance from start to finish, her voice resounds with the agony and strength of the woman she plays. In ‘Vissi d’arte’, one of the opera’s acclaimed arias, Tosca’s pained address to God held the audience’s breath, before provoking the production’s only round of applause mid-scene.</p><p>It is these voices of course that are the light of opera. Listening to their crystal sharpness, their tantalising urgency, their booming fury, it’s hard not to feel as though there is something transcendent at play. It’s not simply that they are beautiful, that it is incredible to hear the human voice reach such heights and such depths, it is the feeling, released from deeper within the performer and the music, that so captivates. In such a beguiling opera as <em>Tosca</em>, staged to perfection by Scottish Opera, it speaks to the human empathy and loneliness that is surely accessible to all.</p><p><em>Scottish Opera: Tosca runs at the Festival Theatre on the 14, 17, 21 and 23 November 2019. </em></p>",

      "title": "Doja Cat – Hot Pink Album Review",
      "html": "<p><strong>Doja Cat</strong> welcomes you to her bold, colorful and scandalous world on her sophomore album <em>Hot Pink</em>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/2019/11/DC-Garden--2.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Whether it is Taylor Swift’s transition from Country Sweetheart to Pop Powerhouse, or Nicki Minaj’s incorporation of Pop and R&amp;B to mostly Hip-Hop bodies of work, artists have been experimenting with different genres for years; and if 2019-breathrough stars Lil Nas X and Lizzo have managed to top the charts with singles that are difficult to fit into a unique category, they are certainly not the only  genre non-conformists out there.<br>Doja Cat’s debut album <em>Amala</em> – released in March 2018 and upgraded almost a year later with new tracks such as the viral hit ‘Mooo!’ and the Rico Nasty-assisted Rap anthem ‘Tia Tamera’ – showcases a mixture of Pop, R&amp;B and Hip-Hop on almost every track. Her versatility, witty lyricism and unmatched creativity have since sparked the interest of many, making her follow-up project <em>Hot Pink</em> a very exciting way to conclude the decade.</p><p>Doja Cat kicks off the album with ‘Cyber Sex’ and ‘Won’t Bite’, two songs that offer a refreshing take on her signature style from <em>Amala</em>, making the transition from one album to the other flow perfectly.<br>‘Cyber Sex’ is an ode Doja’s online boyfriend. On the dreamy chorus she sings “Wish you were here right now / All of the things I'd do / I wanna get freaky on camera / I love when we get freaky on camera”, she then effortlessly shifts to an exciting rap verse describing what seems to be a perfect modern-day romance (“And he don’t even scroll through insta / ‘Less he going through my pictures”). What makes the song so enjoyable – and an amazing album opener – is the singer’s animated personality that is perfectly reflected through voice and flow changes. For Doja, nothing is too racy lyrically (“surf that 'til I drown in all of your pics / Can't scroll down cause some of them dicks”), nor visually as she literally gets “freaky on camera” to the excitement of internet strangers and creates her own lab-boyfriend in the song’s official music video.<br>The singer’s wish for an artificial boyfriend might come from whoever the next track is about. On ‘Won’t Bite’, Doja Cat lets her man know she is sweet as long as she is treated well (“I’m such a good kitty, don’t put up fights / But if you trick me, baby, it gon’ get sticky / I might, bite”). It is another playful versatile song and has an incredibly catchy post-chorus. Additionally, American rapper Smino matches Doja Cat’s energy with the best guest appearance of the album.</p><p>Next up is ‘Rules’, a single that took the Hip-Hop Twitter community by storm after its release, two weeks before the album, with clips from the music video sometimes gaining tens of thousands of likes on the platform, and rightfully so. On one of her most heavily Rap records yet, Doja Cat is more assertive than ever and opens with the line “Said play with my pussy / But don’t play with my emotions” and continues with “If you spend some money / Then maybe I just might fuck ya”. She echoes that second idea on the first verse with the metaphor “break bread up, that butter my biscuit”, reiterating that she will only allow her partner to make love to her if he shares his fortune with her. However, what makes this track a real showstopper is the fantastic second verse, where Doja Cat proves she is more than worthy of her title of ‘rapper’ as she switches from one flow to another with incredible ease on many occasions, spits more bright bars, gives bold orders and radiates with confidence. The artist’s attitude on the track is flawlessly portrayed on its accompanying visuals where she plays the role of a head of mafia and shares the screen with a snake.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UVadfCxNnoY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>The singer and rapper proceeds to praise her best friend on the catchy ‘Bottom Bitch’ and sounds sexy as ever on the Disco influenced ‘Say So’ which almost sounds like it belongs on a Carly Rae Jepsen album.<br>‘Bottom Bitch’ and ‘Say So’ have very different styles that perfectly come together on ‘Like That’, probably the most talked-about track on <em>Hot Pink</em> after the tracklist was posted on social media a week early, due to the song’s mystery featured artist. Many fans made it their mission to get the name of her secret collaborator, but Doja never cracked, although she did debunk the very popular theory of a duet with Nicki Minaj. Other names like Kash Doll and Summer Walker seemed more plausible; and while Gucci Mane’s appearance turned out to be rather underwhelming, Doja Cat manages to carry the track and make it one of the album’s standout moments thanks to an infectiously enjoyable hook, another great and audacious rap verse, and a sultry outro.</p><p>Dreamy melodies and vocals are paired with explicit bars on the raunchy but romantic ‘Talk Dirty’. Doja Cat then seems almost euphoric on ‘Addiction’, as she puts her listener in a trance sustained by the mesmerizing ‘Streets’ and ‘Shine’.<br>The former sees the artist longing for a serious romantic relationship with the man of her dreams (“In my head, we belong / And I can’t be without you / Why can’t I find no one like you”).<br>The latter is a steamy and delightful track that mixes the regular sexual content with drips of wealth and luxury. The shining diamonds lyrical aesthetics are impeccably matched by the sonics of the record, incorporating a captivating beat, elegant instrumentals and a Charli XCX-like subtle and luscious use of autotune; which has by contrast been used excessively in recent hip-hop records as a lazy way to make anything sound bearable, proving yet again Doja Cat is highly meticulous when it comes to her craft.<br>This “calmer” part of the album concludes with confident and self-uplifting groovy track ‘Better Than Me’, on the chorus Doja Cat sings “All of them bitches ain’t better than me / I know you wanted somethin’ else at your feet / You gon’ figure out you lost one and that’s me”.</p><p>Finally, a remix version of the <em>Amala</em> bonus track ‘Juicy’ with an additional verse courtesy of American rapper Tyga closes the album to its most radio-friendly track. While the original version is impeccable, Tyga’s verse is a fun way to attract a wider audience and has proven successful, giving Doja Cat her first US Billboard Hot 100 entry after the release of the record’s official fruit-themed music video.</p><p>Overall the album is an extremely welcome project in contemporary music. <em>Hot Pink</em> is creative, daring, fun, sexual, scandalous, confident and very well put together, it sees Doja Cat continuing her journey as one of today’s most interesting new artists.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uDr9hRJqPX4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><hr><p>Ratings for individual songs<br>1.

      "title": "EZRA Review",
      "html": "<p>A secular Jewish family - Ezra, his sister Noya, and their mother Ellen – sit around a Seder dinner table. Following a list of instructions freshly printed from ‘BadJewsDoPassover.com’. the trio blunder through the sacred religious tradition, centred around remembrance of the oft-forgotten. A deeply buried secret, however, lurks beneath this comical veneer.</p><p>Stella Green’s script oozes intrigue from the outset. The idea of the family’s ‘missing year’ in 2004 is carefully developed. What begins with a seemingly innocuous missing photograph of a bad haircut gradually descends into conspiracy against Ezra. And yet, this spiral makes perfect sense. Why can’t Ellen - who religiously purchased her children’s school photographs each year -  explain the lost picture?</p><p>The siblings, Levi Mattey as Ezra and Hannah Churchill as Noya, master the balance between affection and awkward interaction, and Florence Elliot excels as the matter-of-fact mother Ellen. Indeed, the strong cast hides the challenging nature of this piece, whether in Mattey’s convincing portrayal of traumatic stress disorder, or in Yann Davies’ silent, impish Boy.  As such, the viewer is entirely immersed, practically seated in the fourth chair of this family dinner table.</p><p>Aesthetically, it’s faultless. Every minute detail in the costume, staging, and lighting is purposeful. The colour coordination even extends down the washing-peg bag – green silk with bright orange ribbons. The visuals  – both stark and implicit – become all the more haunting as Ezra's secret is slowly revealed, leading up to the final harrowing realisation. A bright orange party hat stands in for the missing image on Ezra’s photograph timeline, before Davies appears on stage dripping wet, in nothing but a similarly-hued pair of trunks.  Jarring music and light is also used sparingly in moments of great suspense, and to great effect.</p><p>Everything about <em>EZRA</em> is subtle, which only amplifies its effect. Through equally captivated script and production, the story of this single Jewish family transcends into a universally haunting experience.</p><p><em>EZRA runs at the Bedlam Theatre until 14 November 2019.</em></p>",

But it’s hard not watch on in awe at the fervent sawing action of the violin play, the rise and fall of the flautists, the cacophony of sound it creates.</p><p>Mahler’s Third Symphony, at 100 minutes, is the longest symphony in the usual repertoire. The vocal contributions are minimal, though exquisite (performed by Ester Pavlů and the NYCOS Edinburgh Choir), and Pavlů’s operatic solo (from the fourth movement) is a particular delight.</p><p>The story too, is bittersweet; a six-movement work performed in two parts. The first, a strong and decisive opening (<em>Kräftig. Entschieden</em>), translated as 'Pan Awakes, Summer Marches In' (with an unexpected, at least to me, inclusion of the funeral march). Next, moving to the delicate and effortless (<em>Tempo di Menuetto</em>; 'What the Flowers in the Meadow Tell Me'), the comfortable and good-tempered <em>Comodo (Scherzando) '</em>What the Animals in the Forest Tell Me'.  Following, the slow and mysterious <em>Sehr langsam—Misterioso ('</em>What Man Tells Me') juxtaposed with the cheeky and cheerful <em>Lustig im Tempo und keck im Ausdruck ('</em>What the Angels Tell Me'), and closing with the tranquil and deeply-felt <em>Langsam—Ruhevoll—Empfunden ('</em>What Love Tells Me').</p><p>The story moves seamlessly through the awakening of nature, a walk through the woods and meadows, an abrupt reminder of nature’s unbridled power (through several off-stage post-horn interjections). Then, a journey through night and day, dreaming and wakefulness, joy and grief, the joys of heaven, and resting at an inspired quest for truth.</p><p>The Usher Hall certainly is a beautiful venue, and I am reminded once more of the varieties that Edinburgh has to offer, with very generous student discounts too. The perfect Sunday afternoon activity, the Sunday Classics offers a wonderful introduction to classical music for the uninitiated such as myself!</p><p><em>Run ended. </em></p><p><em><em>The Sunday Classics International Series 2019-2020 consists of seven concerts by the world's leading orchestras and soloists.

      "title": "Luce Review",
      "html": "<p>Whereas I normally prefer watching trailers (I kid you not, I am a big fan of spoilers), knowing the premise for <em>Luce </em>was enough to prepare me for what I was about to see. In a nutshell: A liberal-minded White couple, Amy (Naomi Watts) and Peter Edgar (Tim Roth), are forced to reconsider their image of their adopted African son (Kelvin Harrington Jr.) after being confronted by his African-American History teacher (Octavia Spencer) about an extremely disturbing essay he has written for his class at school. Apologies for explicitly mentioning and emphasising their race, but I can't help but wonder if you as well can imagine exactly the type of characters, and behaviour, we might expect to be seen in this film. From the many bottles of white or red wine drank by the Edgards, to the blunts smoked by fourth-generation Harvard-prospectives, the entire film is build around these stereotypes of the different peoples existent in American society. Ironically, whereas the plot of the film increasingly tries to rid the younger generation of the older generation who put them on pedestals and crown them hero of the year, it seems that the deeper into the plot we go the more rock solid the characters become in their backgrounds and stereotypes.</p><p>The film revolves on very basic, yet highly politically debatable questions. \"Why you and not me?\" \"What’s the difference between punishing someone for being a stereotype and rewarding them if they’re not?\" \"Why can I only be a saint or a monster?\" This may seem fairly straight forward, if we discard other situations of political importance that have no direct relevance to the plot but do aid the plot in its continue. Think of police brutality and dehumanization of the mentally ill during a public breakdown who coincidentally also happen to be African-American. Think of the issue of consent, false accusations, and (broken) trust of (/in) higher authorities. There are so many elements packed in this film that it seems hard to take them all into account, if we are meant to even take them into account. Does it really matter that our poster-boy and main character Luce grew up the first seven years of his live as an Eritrean child-soldier? Even after the years of therapy (which are never mentioned again, or in detail) was he always doomed to sabotage his academic and sports excellence by an almost psychopathic need for violence? (And here introduced is another topic: extreme violence in high schools). By touching upon all these subjects, what exactly is the main issue the film wants to address?</p><p><em>Luce</em> is set up to be a psychological puzzle on who's speaking or even seeing the truth, how far does trust go, does background really set you up for life / can it be changed / does it explain why you go of the rails, what does behaviour say about the truth of your actions, and maybe most importantly – should you really trust someone who is a smiling goody two shoes all the freakin' time? My mind is still going in circles trying to find out what is at the heart of this film. Because it touches on so many political, philosophical, contemporary topics I can see this film go far – but only if these topics are in depth explored in their rightful context. I'm not sure if I would have preferred Julius Onah's and JC Lee's original theatre play over their later adaptation to film. Apart from the stellar performances, I would have a hard time getting into the mindset without Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury's amazing <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fad5cMUjebA\">soundtrack</a>. The melodic somber organ alternated with an up tempo industrial beat gives a sense of timelessness and urgency to the film. All in all, to me it feels like <em>Luce, </em>instead of breaking the boundaries and stereotypes between people, for now still caters to the en<em>light</em>ened.<br></p><p><em>Luce is in cinemas now.</em></p><p><em><em><em><em>Reviewed as Film of the Week, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CameoCinema/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAKPislawMGrxiIlOlKYIP0GVXzfAUHgmBMjXHmpalXq5DqZ0ekPOKWkVhdpl0anMOypoM_ffelobqg&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3m5rVwBfwOJBI9lTeXSVSV4IYSi-mkvNZrxLjX3sf9xQMBIfwQHqmnOVhTFYMde1OP-K_JXHjoyELZdbrRqQDXdlHV7H5DG6KX3FTQ1Fzhb3w-GoG7ijjb_l1NfYC7DJv3itREpuLqx53UleCbHFCPh1eylwt12_xPafkq3MvN_UySxZGvJea5I8ZySnFlrWmbaCut5-8BkE3Ga1Ro4DBM_S-mnuCuqcAOjZTcwpJqLTYt5CiI89TWL2qeKxQIcA6kU0MUg_evAWOWlP6z0X2xgsM-IjI0zCr9irfz-vyW5yJGaFEwKoHbNAOIRGXXX4EEs4yA24RniNW96daiVU\">Cameo Cinema</a>, Edinburgh</em></em>.</em></em></p>",

      "html": "<p>50 years ago, the publication of A. J. Youngson’s <em>The Making of Classical Edinburgh</em> brought to light the neglect of Edinburgh’s Georgian New Town and began a process of conservation which eventually led to the establishment of the Edinburgh New Town Conservation Committee, now known as Edinburgh World Heritage. <em>Classical Edinburgh</em>, the new exhibition at City Art Centre allows for a moment of reflection on how much (and more often, how little) Edinburgh and its New Town have changed over the past 50 years. </p><p>The exhibition shows the work of photographer Edwin Smith, whose photographs of Edinburgh first featured in Youngson’s book, alongside that of Colin McLean, who replicates and reinterprets Smith’s work, both in black and white and colour photography, with excellent results. </p><p>There is a good sense of cohesion between the work of Smith and McLean and it is easy to match up the photographs which show the same view from each period and fascinating to see the differences in architecture, traffic flow and city layout. At times, it would be of benefit and interest to the viewer to see McLean’s work situated directly alongside Smith’s but the overall layout of the exhibition is clear and the photographs are given the space to be appreciated without ever feeling overcrowded or sparse.  </p><p>McLean’s work finds a middle ground of distinct separation from Edwin’s photographs without ever straying too far from the clear aim of appreciating and reflecting on the latter’s work. The featuring of people in the images was particularly notable in this regard; both photographers captured the scenes as they found them and very few of the photographs came across as false or staged in this way. Consequently, there is a lovely natural truth to both the old and contemporary photographs, and we get the sense that the people seen in the photographs are as much a part of the city as the architecture surrounding them.</p><p>More than anything, this exhibition is a celebration of Edinburgh, in all its grandeur, intricacy and beauty. McLean noted in particular the difference in traffic levels and pollution between the two periods, which can be seen especially well in a photograph taken from Salisbury Crags in the 1950s in which Edinburgh Castle can barely be seen in the distance due to air pollution. Despite being undeniably haunting in beauty, this reminds us of the responsibility of care we have for this wonderfully unique and historic city we have the pleasure to call home.</p><p><em>Classical Edinburgh runs at the City Art Centre until 8 March 2020.  </em></p>",

It’s the 30s in pre-WW2 Berlin and everyone is having a wonderful time it seems at the infamous Kit Kat Klub.</p><p>It’s difficult not to be entranced by the decadence and kinkiness of it all. The sheer hedonism itself is dizzying. Emcee’s scene-setting, (played by John Partridge), is perhaps hedonism personified, and serves as a great anchor to the story line. The character is for the audience’s benefit alone, seeing as there is no interaction between Emcee and the other characters in the play. Equally, Emcee’s exaggerated stage-presence is delightful, but also serves a greater purpose. Emcee reflects the indulgences of Berlin’s people, for better or for worse.</p><p>The story is set around the aspiring American novelist Cliff Bradshaw, (played by Charles Hagerty), who sees 30s Berlin through the audience’s eyes, a sexually-liberated and overwhelming city, where, perhaps unlike the US at the time, Bradshaw’s bisexuality is the least eyebrow raising thing happening. Bradshaw meets Ernst Ludwig (played by Nick Tizzard) at the station and is introduced to Fraulein Schneiders, (played by Anita Harris), the owner of a boarding house where Bradshaw takes a room. From there, we meet the characters Herr Schultz, (played by James Paterson), and Fraulein Kost, (played by Basienka Blake), (who, let’s just say, has a certain <em>penchant </em>for sailors).</p><p>Cliff Bradshaw meets British Singer, (Kara Lily Hayworth), at the aforementioned Kit Kat Klub, and comments poignantly on the dream-like sensation of their relationship. There’s a hypnotic sense to the scenes on stage, as the audience too, joins the couple in this dream-state.</p><p>All the while, the darkness of the Nazi party’s ever-growing presence in Germany takes hold, and the set is sent spiraling into louder, more catastrophic scenes. Emcee’s kick-line and burlesque routine is transformed to a goose-step and the once-bright lights slowly twinkle to blackness, there is an unmistakable political overtone to the play. And one that seems ever-relevant once more.</p><p><em>Cabaret runs at the Festival Theatre until 9 November 2019.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p><em>Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off</em> is a comedic take on the life of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland and her rivalry with her cousin Queen Elizabeth the first. You’ll see Scottish queens, Scottish accents and all performed in Scottish weather. Seriously, it’s cold, bring a blanket. They do hand out a few blankets and hot water bottles at the start, but better safe than sorry. Laura Hounsell gives a playful direction of Liz Lochead’s fast-paced dark comedy. Kirsten Millar sets the tone as the ‘corbie’ who is narrator of the play, acting as bridge between audience and production. Megan Lambie is similarly sensational as a jealous Elizabeth the first and Will Peppercorn’s comedic timing as the whimpering Darnley is inspired. Credit must be payed to the brilliant set and tech crew headed by Elissa Webb and Matthew Marsland, who create a simultaneously period-accurate yet modern set, perfectly matching the play’s modern take on historic events. </p><p>The atmosphere was gently immersive, the cast move around the space – particularly the corbie who can be behind you at any moment – surrounding the audience a bubble of activity. The two queens each play each other’s  maids making the movement between scenes much more cohesive, and further portraying the distance but ever-present pressure on the relation. Due to inconsistencies in the cast, the pace of the production can slow at times. However, the more playful moments, such the dance of Salome or subtly lewd songs, bring the audience back in rhythm with the fast-moving events of the play. The play starts and ends with chaos; you enter to the honking of the accordion and leave with a cult-like chant. Overall the play is enjoyable and will guarantee a laugh. In a time when Scottish independence seems impending, the play is a topical, dark and funny exploration of the historic tension between the neighbouring nations.</p><p><em>Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off runs at the Bedlam Theatre until 9 October 2019. </em></p>",

      "title": "The Exorcist Review",
      "html": "<p><i>The Exorcist </i>is based on the 1973 horror film of the same name. The film scared audiences so much one reviewer said there was so much vomit in the bathroom at the showing that he couldn’t get to the sinks. Its catalyst is when Regan, a 12-year-old girl, starts exhibiting horrifying physical, mental, and sexual symptoms. It is suggested that she is possessed.</p><p>The play started off with a massive bomb sound and the lights slamming off. When ‘Dracula’ at the Kings did the same thing a year ago, I accepted my death instantly. This year, I felt an affinity for the noise, and welcomed it like an old friend. My heart rode a horse and cantered over a hillock.</p><p>After that, the play became silly. Every single scene ended with a loud explosion of some sort. Often, the previous scene was funny, so the crash of symbols in a reaction of horror at what has come to pass made the audience laugh even more. In one scene, Regan masturbates with a crucifix. Even the cast seemed on the edge of corpsing in this scene. In fact, the cast seemed completely removed from their characters’ horror. They focused almost entirely on sounding like characters from a 1970s film, but as a result rushed through the scenes and didn’t invest in their physicality or facial expressions. The lines expressed fear and darkness, but the cast stood blank faced and wooden-bodied. The priests pottered about like gardeners while exorcising the devil himself.</p><p>The set design (Anna Fleischle) created hotspots of atmospheric strength. One of my favourites was that there was a high window above the house where most of the play takes place, which evoked the sense that the characters were stuck down in hell. Through the window, there was a beautiful, dreamlike mist, that I yearned to fly up and out into. Nearby, the colours of the stained glass in a church where two characters converse were on the edge of being satanic, which removed a lot of comfort surrounding the idea of religion and the power of God. Overall, though, the set had a plasticky look to it, and the numerous rooms on stage and constant set changes felt very cluttered. This meant the audience couldn’t envelop themselves in the world of the play. There were things constantly telling them it wasn’t real.</p><p>This show was fun in places to watch, and it made me laugh a lot. I’ll give it three stars because its humour meant it wasn’t tedious. It was clear, however, that the show tried hard to evoke the darkness of evil. The way it failed is quite a sorry state of affairs for everyone involved.</p><p><i>The Exorcist runs at the King’s Theatre until 9 November 2019.</i></p>",

      "html": "<p>On 10 October, on World Mental Health Day, the new exhibition <em>Out of Sight, Out of Mind </em>was launched at Summerhall. Now returning for its seventh year, the amount of artworks presented has grown to an astonishing 400 since its debut in 2013 as part of the Scottish Mental Health Arts Festival. The multimedia exhibition features any possible form of art imaginable – from wood structures, mirror installations, earthenware, plaster to any material that produces an imprint on anything that can be considered a blank sheet. The diversity of media shows the diversity of experiences the hundreds of artists have experienced or experience on a daily basis with their mental health issues. The artworks create a voice for them and give them the ability to communicate these experiences to a wider audience, without attaching these experiences to themselves specifically and thus breaking the barrier between themselves, their experience and the viewer/listener. <em>Out of Sight, Out of Mind </em>has different meanings for people who exhibit in, organise and visit the exhibition.</p><p>The artists presented in <em>Out of Sight, Out of Mind </em>are funded and support by various groups, such as CAPS Independent Advocacy, NHS Lothian Sense of Belonging Arts Programme and Edinburgh and Lothian Health Foundation. Coming from different backgrounds, and being created in different contexts and for different reasons, the artists in the exhibition demand the visitor's attention for them as individuals, regardless of their DSM diagnosis, name, condition or therapy group. A variety of motivations, ranging from personal expression, development of artistic practice, experiencing the therapeutic benefits of working in a group or solo, formal art therapy or political activism stands behind the artists choice to submit the artwork to the open call for the exhibition.</p><p>The point of the exhibition is not to exhibit the head-clutching well-known image of the mentally ill patient, nor is it to exhibit artworks created in a hospital setting or under therapy. In fact, the labels accompanying the artworks are written by the artists themselves, who choose whether they want to add additional information, write their name, or even mention what they are dealing with in a day to day life. <em>Out of Sight, Out of Mind</em>, is simply an exhibition by artists who through various means share an aspect of their life, which may or may not have been influenced by their mental health issues. The result is a refreshing mix of bright vibrant colours and breath-stopping raw expressions of emotion and perception. At times it deals with very tough subjects, and at times it just wants the visitor the know that the artist is happy and doing okay. With enough book-material to read up on, volunteers to help you out if you're feeling (emotionally) unwell, and flyers and leaflets of where to go if the experience was a bit too familiar or triggering, <em>Out of Sight, Out of Mind </em>tries to break the stigma surrounding various mental health issues and shows that in the end we are all individuals, going through better and rougher times. To all the artists who have participated - we are listening. </p><p><em>Run ended.</em></p><p><em>For more information on mental health and the arts in Edinburgh, and on how to participate in </em>Out of Sight, Out of Mind 2020, <em>see <a href=\"http://www.mhfestival.com/\">www.mhfestival.com</a>.</em></p><p><em>The artwork is '</em>Untitled<em>' by participating artist Derek Higgisson.  </em><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

      "html": "<p>“First and foremost, it is a portrait of a family”; writer Paul Laverty’s insight into his thirteenth film in collaboration with Director and friend Ken Loach is illuminating and adds depth to what is already accomplished screenwriting. </p><p>I was lucky enough to be present for a Q and A session with Laverty at the Cameo Cinema on Friday evening after a showing of the film, in which he shed light on his research and writing process, informing the audience that as far fetched and unbelievable the challenges faced by the characters seem, they are inspired by real stories, they do happen and they often never see the light of day. That is, until now.</p><p>For father of two Ricky Turner (Kris Hitchen), becoming a self-employed franchisee of a parcel delivery firm seems a welcome respite from dominating employers of his past, however, it soon becomes apparent that such gig economy jobs are not as freeing as they appear. Ricky’s wife Abbie (Debbie Honeywood) is in a similar situation, working a zero hour contract as a home visit nurse; Abbie is undeniably the heart of her family and Honeywood’s first time performance is truthful, humble and easily wins the hearts of the audience. </p><p>Laverty notes that the film is intended as a warning against the modern technology we now find dominating the workplace, the parcel scanners used by the drivers are a focal point of this, as franchisor Maloney says: “This decides who lives and who dies.” By placing drivers under relentless pressure and pitting them against one another for the best routes and fastest delivery times, the worker is exploited and degraded. As part of his research, Laverty spend time at work with real delivery drivers and was shocked at the speed with which they are meant to complete their route, sometimes not even having a spare moment to eat. </p><p>Ultimately, the consequences of Ricky and Abbie’s work lives impact their children and the distress and damage is clear. Similar to Loach’s previous work, the shooting style is muted, honest and unembellished with black screens separating the scenes and desperately little score within the film itself. While this ultimately made the use of music, when it came, all the more potent and emotive, it did feel that the film was somewhat lacking in emotional guidance for the audience at times. But, to credit Loach’s style and the cinematography and editing of Robbie Ryan and Jonathan Morris (respectively), the muted style communicated the tone and aim of the film well.</p><p>A strong script, cast and established style make Sorry We Missed You a potent piece of cinema which knows what it wants to say, yet offers no solution to the problem it highlights. Instead the audience is challenged to think differently about a form of consumerism which has embedded itself into our modern world and the real human consequences that we never see.</p><p><em><br>Sorry We Missed You is in cinemas now.</em></p><p><em><br><em>Reviewed as Film of the Week, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CameoCinema/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAKPislawMGrxiIlOlKYIP0GVXzfAUHgmBMjXHmpalXq5DqZ0ekPOKWkVhdpl0anMOypoM_ffelobqg&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3m5rVwBfwOJBI9lTeXSVSV4IYSi-mkvNZrxLjX3sf9xQMBIfwQHqmnOVhTFYMde1OP-K_JXHjoyELZdbrRqQDXdlHV7H5DG6KX3FTQ1Fzhb3w-GoG7ijjb_l1NfYC7DJv3itREpuLqx53UleCbHFCPh1eylwt12_xPafkq3MvN_UySxZGvJea5I8ZySnFlrWmbaCut5-8BkE3Ga1Ro4DBM_S-mnuCuqcAOjZTcwpJqLTYt5CiI89TWL2qeKxQIcA6kU0MUg_evAWOWlP6z0X2xgsM-IjI0zCr9irfz-vyW5yJGaFEwKoHbNAOIRGXXX4EEs4yA24RniNW96daiVU\">Cameo Cinema</a>, Edinburgh</em>.</em></p>",

His Hibernian side sat one point above the SPL’s bottom side St Johnstone before kick-off, without a win on the league since the opening day of the season and having surrendered winning positions in each of their last five, having lost a total of 13 points from such positions all season. </p><p>Unfortunately for Heckingbottom, he didn’t even have the opportunity to see his side take the lead on this occasion as two quick-fire goals just before half time from Livingston courtesy of Steven Lawless and Craig Sibbald, both partly owing to some questionable defending, gave the away side control of an extremely cagy game.</p><p>Hibernian were not short of chances of their own, with Glenn Middleton and Daryl Horgan teeing up chances for each other which forced saves from Livi goalkeeper Matjia Sarkic, who also produced a stunning save to deny a long-distance effort from Tom James at 0-0.</p><p>In spite of Hibs’ best efforts, they sauntered off at half-time to deafening boos at two goals down, many surely expecting that Paul Heckingbottom was giving his last half-time team talk at Easter Road.</p><p>Hibernian appeared rejuvenated at the start of the second half, Scott Allan drawing a foul from Livingston captain Alan Lithgow before burying the resulting penalty. However, Livingston looked to have the victory sealed as Scott Tiffoney intercepted a sloppy backpass and rounded Chris Maxwell in the home goal, but incredibly sent his shot wide from all of two yards out.</p><p>This proved to be the lifeline Hibernian needed, and if there was any doubt the momentum was not in their favour in the closing stages, Australia international Martin Boyle, yet to feature for Hibernian this season due to a knee injury, entered the fray greeted by a rapturous applause. All he needed was one opportunity, which fell his way in the 91st minute as a fatal lapse of Livi concentration saw one long ball set him on his way, as he calmly tucked the ball into the bottom right without even really breaking stride.</p><p>This may well be the goal that keeps Paul Heckingbottom in a job for the time being, which is more than can be said for cross-city rival Hearts manager Craig Levein, who was sent packing as his side were buried by bottom side St Johnstone and were set to the bottom of the pile themselves. Although there were boos on the full-time whistle, these became rounds of applause as the home side left the field, their supporters acknowledging the second-half turnaround.</p><p>Heckingbottom spoke in his post-match interview about the one-to-one training sessions he had been having with Martin Boyle during his recovery, and he is clearly under no illusions that his No. 10 will be a key factor as Hibs try to turn their season around. Boyle will have a tough job though, with a League Cup semi-final against Celtic on the cards this weekend, a side whose form contrasts hugely to that of Hibernian, who are now 12 games without a win inside 90 minutes. Livingston, meanwhile, visit Motherwell in the league, and although manager Gary Ross didn’t appear too disappointed despite his side’s second half collapse on Wednesday, he will certainly want to see a response this weekend.</p><p>Peter Johnson.</p>",

      "html": "<p>“Red or white ?!” Before I've fully acclimatised to the basement room filled with book lovers, story-lovers, and most of all, wine-lovers, I get offered a fancy glass of wine and cookies masquerading as canapés. Surrounded by the best editions of a variety of genres, at regular intervals interspersed with unique and antique typewriters, it certainly is remarkably easy to feel at home at Tom's little treasury, Typewronger Books. Being somewhat of a story-listener virgin, I was unsure what to expect from the night's featured guests.</p><p><em>Haunting Voices: An Anthology of Gothic Storytelling from Scotland, </em>came to life in the mind of Rebecca Wojturska. Via a kick starter, she managed to combine the long storytelling traditions of various families and areas in Scotland, with the multimedia of today and their digital storytellers. What could have been more chilling and goosebumps-raising than introducing a few of these amazing storytellers and their Gothic stories to our literary hungry minds on the eve before Samhuinn?</p><p>From Max Scratchmann, who weaves the threads of the past into a visual image with his disarming voice and amicable demeanor, to Daiva Ivanauskaitė who, quite literally, puts us under her spell with her animated speech and effects. By slowing down, speeding up, and letting the silence linger the highly skilled artists weave us into their web and guide us through (O)therwordly imaginative journeys.</p><p>The evening is concluded by a mixed media example provided by the Aletheian Society. The story, which involves multiple tellers is here supported by digital sound effects. Every week a new episode in the form of a podcast will be published on the society's website.</p><p>And just like that – the spell has broken and the evening returns to normal. One after the other witnesses to the event filter out through the door and disappear into the dark, cold, night. Finally having collected my courage, I follow them into the darkness too. Next time I definitely know which one I want – red... bloody red, please.</p><p><em>Run ended.</em></p>",

      "title": "Samhuinn Fire Festival Review",
      "html": "<p>As a true nerd of all things obscure, especially Celtic culture, I was tremendously excited to be able to join in on the ancient rituals concerning Samhain (Samhuinn in Scottish Gaelic). And I was not alone – it was sold out, meaning about 7,000 people would light up windy, cold, and dark Calton Hill for the second appearance of Samhuinn Fire Festival in that location.</p><p>The organisation is in hands of the Beltane Fire Society, who manage the Samhuinn and Beltane version every year. Two months in advance performers come together and weave together a story that reflects Scotland's Celtic past and ensures the old ritual practices will continued to be used for years to come. These ancient celebrations include the lightning of the sacred Neid fire, which was believed to be purifying and relit the hearth in each home. Tiny details like these are abundant in the festival, where all the fire presented is also lit from one single flame, which this year will symbolise community and together in uncertain Winter times.<br></p><p>Witnesses who have been paying attention to big, and small, symbols enacted by the hundred of volunteers will recognize the changing of the seasons by reinterpretation of Celtic traditions. Stories borrowed from Scottish folklore are shown in a dazzling max of fire play, interactive theatre, acrobatics, and drumming. Both the performing groups and the witnesses are free to move all over Calton Hill to assigned areas whose placement play a role as well in the story.</p><p>During a time when the veil between our world and the Otherworld is thinnest, who knows what kinds of creatures may fall through. Such as the beasties, Valravn and others. They aid the Winter King and the Summer King in their struggle for the seasons, eventually decided by the Cailleach, a mysterious crone goddess aligned with Winter. After the Winter king has won for this year, they all come together at the Hearth to enjoy the Samhuinn fire.</p><p>The location, the atmosphere, and if you carefully ignore the flashing cameras all around, you can almost imagine yourself 500 years in the past. Standing in the exact same spot, holding the exact same hot tea being mesmerized by the skills of the performers who become otherworldly beings. Though we live in an era of modern laws and requirement, it is great to see a historic event being able to be performed in an almost traditional setting – the whole of Calton Hill was (almost) only lit up by natural fire. It is a shame that not everyone has the ability to allow their imagination to wander and simply be amazed by the amount of love the Beltane Fire Society has for their rituals and traditions. As much as I enjoyed being swooped up in the festivities, people reeking like alcohol and others blatantly shouting their version of Wonder Wall through a stunning performance of traditional Scottish Gaelic songs did ruin it a bit for me.</p><p>All in all, visiting the Samhuinn Fire Festival was the best decision for celebrating Halloween I've ever made and I will most definitely return for Beltane in the Spring. Perhaps even as a volunteer myself.</p><p><em>The Beltane Fire Society returns for the Beltane Fire Festival in Spring 2020, and Samhuinn Fire Festival in Autumn 2020. </em><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

      "title": "Kanye West - 'Jesus is King' Album Review",
      "html": "<p>In September of last year, Kanye West announced his ninth solo album, titled <em>Yandhi</em>. It was to cap off what had been a very busy year for West; a solo album, a collaboration with Kid Cudi, executive production on three albums and a slate of singles and features, not to mention all the provocative interviews and generally bizarre things he was getting up to. <em>Yandhi</em>, however, never materialised. Instead we received over a year of leaks, near media blackouts, random snippets from West’s Sunday Service and a series of changing tracklists and release dates, before finally ‘Jesus is King’, a gospel album, was released on the 25<sup>th</sup> of October.</p><p>Where West merely paid lip service to the idea of a gospel album on <em>The Life of Pablo</em>, he fully embraces it on <em>Jesus Is King</em>. Religion is no longer relegated to a supporting role, it is the core of the album, permeating into the lyrics and musical style of every song.</p><p>This new and rather serious subject matter rubs right up against West’s trademark lack of subtlety. His corniness normally gives a light-hearted edge to his work, but here gives us a healthy dose of eye-rolling and preachy bars. There is, however, some nuance on display. West does, at multiple points, address his less than saintly past and the recent tension with the Christian community over his renewal of faith, but never quite reaches the heights of self-reflection or emotional openness shown on his 2018 album, <em>Ye</em>.</p><p>One way that <em>Jesus Is King</em> does match West’s recent work is that instead of the sprawling indulgence of <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em> or<em> The Life of Pablo</em>, <em>Jesus Is King</em> is only 27 minutes long. Despite this, West and a selection of big name producers, including Pi’erre Bourne, Timbaland and Ronny J, provide an impressive range in production.</p><p>The opening tracks, ‘Every Hour’ and ‘Selah’, use West’s Sunday Service Choir and booming drums to great effect, building to an epic chorus of “Hallelujah”, whilst ‘Follow God’ uses West’s classic technique of flipping soul samples into dynamic and driving beats for one of the best songs on the record.</p><p>The fifth track, ‘On God’, features an almost <em>Graduation</em>-era instrumental of upbeat synths as a backdrop for Kanye’s most interesting array of lyrics on the project. West emphatically discusses his near death experiences, his mixed past, the prison-industrial complex and randomly throws in the proclamation that he is “The greatest artist restin’ or alive”, showing that despite the delve into scripture, he’s not quite mastered the virtue of humility.</p><p>‘Everything We Need’ is adapted from the leaked <em>Yandhi</em>song, ‘The Storm’, stripping back some of the layers of instrumentation and probably wisely cutting an XXXTentacion feature to leave a laid back song that flows nicely into the Lo-fi ‘Water’, both of which feature well fitting vocals from frequent Kanye collaborator Ty Dollar $ign and singer Ant Clemons.</p><p>Then, after the song most likely to remind you of a mandatory Christmas service, ‘God Is’, and the subdued, meditative ‘Hands On’, comes the final full track and the highlight of the whole album. ‘Use This Gospel’, sees the reunion of the Thornton brothers as the duo, ‘Clipse’. The first collaboration of repentant Christian rapper, No Malice, and his younger brother, Pusha T, since 2013 provides an apt metaphor for the bringing together of West’s newfound religious fervour with his long-dominant Id. Accompanying Clipse’s two thunderous, if sparingly short, verses, is a rather bare instrumental mainly consisting of a heavily autotuned choir used for a powerful, surging beat, interrupted only by an inexplicable Kenny G saxophone solo.</p><p>West often projects a chaotic persona, but on <em>Jesus Is King</em>, there is a distinct feeling of calm. West seems as peaceful as he did on his last full project, 2018’s <em>Kids See Ghosts</em> with Kid Cudi, a short but focused and complete project. In stark contrast however, the reworkings of <em>Yandhi</em>songs, discarding of features and entire concepts, plus the last-minute remixing of tracks seem to have left <em>Jesus Is King</em> a confused and sometimes unfinished sounding album.</p><p>Despite that, there are moments of pure genius and whole sections of fantastic energy, underpinned by a sincere devotion that shines through even the clumsy delivery. <em>Jesus Is King</em> represents a new shift in an incredibly varied career and with the follow up, <em>Jesus Is Born</em>, already scheduled for Christmas, God only knows what direction this new, devout, family-friendly Kanye West is going to take us next.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" title=\"Spotify Embed: JESUS IS KING\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0FgZKfoU2Br5sHOfvZKTI9\"></iframe></figure>",

      "title": "The Last Black Man in San Francisco Review",
      "html": "<p><em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em> follows Jimmie Fails and Montgomery ‘Mont’ Allen, two best friends in San Francisco. They are young and black, and live together in a tiny apartment with Allen’s blind, elderly father. They often walk past a house which Fails believes his grandfather built with his bare hands. He is sad about how the owners have neglected it, and often paints and does up the house when they’re not there. When an owner’s mother dies, their family starts fighting over the house, leaving it empty. Fails and Allen have a chance to enter.</p><p>The film is semi-autobiographical. The actor who plays Jimmie Fails has the same name and had a similar house with family history attached to it as a child. The film’s director, Joe Talbot, and him grew up together, and constructed the film’s ideas as teenagers.</p><p>Their passion for the story is conveyed in an astounding way. The acting by the entire cast is excellent. Jimmie Fails and Jonathan Majors (Allen) beautifully convey their characters’ creativity and introversion in a world that doesn’t seem to appreciate it. They are emotionally truthful, and don’t lose that mesmeric quality despite the challenges their characters face. Tichina Arnold as Fails’ aunt Wanda provides a contrast-she shows her struggle between trying to be happy about things and knowing she must defend herself and others from deceit. She is reserved and cautious.</p><p>Danny Glover as Grandpa Allen and Rob Morgan as Fails’ father both create a sense of danger in the play. They are the only ones whose opinions Fails and Allen’s opinions seem vulnerable in front of. In part, this is because they mean so much to them. Towards the end of the film, a man called Kofi, who argued and fought and was shot dead on the street for ‘talking s***’ was said to have said ‘people aren’t one thing’. Glover and Morgan, as well as Jamal Trulove as Kofi, epitomise this quote.</p><p>Everyone else is just as brilliant, including the production team. The musical score is rich and gorgeous, focusing on old tunes and classical orchestra pieces. This is in contrast with the film’s urban setting where the audience and characters are unsure if things are beautiful or not. The shots linger and mix an enticing colour scheme with images of urban decay. The script celebrates the importance of these images, giving just as much time to them as it does to speech. Over time, Fails and Allen’s hold on the house begins to be questioned. It explores the concepts of how history is written, how people come to ‘own’ property, and what is made visible and invisible in a gentrified city such as San Francisco.</p><p>The film’s large downfall is that it plods in sections. The main conflict-who has a grip of the house-is firmly established early on. The two hours running time feels a bit long because there is little thematic development, so the film seems a little unrewarding at the end.</p><p>However, this film is artistically and intellectually excellent - and I am going to read a book on general history soon, because this film has reminded me there’s a lot of history hidden everywhere.</p><p><em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco is in cinemas now.</em></p><p><em><em>Reviewed as Film of the Week, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CameoCinema/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAKPislawMGrxiIlOlKYIP0GVXzfAUHgmBMjXHmpalXq5DqZ0ekPOKWkVhdpl0anMOypoM_ffelobqg&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3m5rVwBfwOJBI9lTeXSVSV4IYSi-mkvNZrxLjX3sf9xQMBIfwQHqmnOVhTFYMde1OP-K_JXHjoyELZdbrRqQDXdlHV7H5DG6KX3FTQ1Fzhb3w-GoG7ijjb_l1NfYC7DJv3itREpuLqx53UleCbHFCPh1eylwt12_xPafkq3MvN_UySxZGvJea5I8ZySnFlrWmbaCut5-8BkE3Ga1Ro4DBM_S-mnuCuqcAOjZTcwpJqLTYt5CiI89TWL2qeKxQIcA6kU0MUg_evAWOWlP6z0X2xgsM-IjI0zCr9irfz-vyW5yJGaFEwKoHbNAOIRGXXX4EEs4yA24RniNW96daiVU\">Cameo Cinema</a>, Edinburgh</em>.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>Hibernian went into this game without a win since the opening day of the season. Having surrendered winning positions from their last 4 league games, they sat 11th and in desperate need of a win to rid their early season blues and kick on in the campaign. Ross county sat 6th but were looking to bounce back after a 6-0 thrashing by current leaders Celtic.<br>Hibs started the first half on the front foot, striking the crossbar early on from a 25 yard Hallberg free-kick. 20 minutes later, a low strike from Kamberi inside the box was well saved by Laidlaw before a superb Ross Draper block sent Josh Velas shot wide. Hibs had the majority of possession in the first half, but a lack of creativity in the final third meant that the teams went into half time level.<br>The second half proved different for both teams. Hibs again started brightly, getting a goal in the 49th minute after a neat pass from Naismith put Daryl Horgan in space who kept his composure and placed it into the bottom left corner. Despite pressure from Ross County, Hibs managed to find the back of the net again. Josh Vela won the ball back on the halfway and threaded it through to Allan, who dribbled across the box and buried in the bottom left corner. Hibs 2-0 up at home with half an hour to play, seemed in control and likely to win. However, Ross County were allowed to wander up the field, feeding Brian Graham who spun the defender with ease and finessed it into the top right corner. Graham should have made it 2-2 moments later, after he glanced a free header wide. Easter Road were increasingly getting more frustrated as Hibs sat back and allowed County to enjoy easy possession. In the 89th minute, County levelled through a 25-yard wonder strike from Joe Chalmers. Chalmers was allowed acres off space giving him time to line up his shot and find the bottom right corner. County looked the more likely to win it at the end having all the possession, but it was not to be. The match finished 2-2, with Hibs fans calling for Heckingbottom’s head at the final whistle.</p><p><br>Hibs head coach Paul Heckingbottom: “It's two points lost, without a doubt. Although we wouldn't say to you guys, we sometimes say to the players, 'It's been an officiating decision', things like that. Certainly not today. At 2-0 we look comfortable, had a really, really big chance to make it three, and I think that'd put the game to bed, but we didn't. It's two points dropped, you can't hide that.\"</p><p><br>Ross County co-manager Steven Ferguson: \"We were certainly looking like the team that were going to win it in the end. We were disappointed in the goals we lost but we felt the response was great. We could have easily downed tools and lay down, but the players didn't do that and 2-2 is probably a fair result. We'll take the point; it feels more like three.\"</p><p><br>Hibs remain 11th on 8 points whereas County sit 6th on 13 points. Heckingbottom’s time at Easter Road appears to be running out as fans voice their anger, having now not won in 9 league games. The steel that characterised the Neil Lennon era and early days of Heckingbottom seems to have gone. The lack of quality signings in the summer are beginning to show.<br>Hibs face Livingston at home next week in a must-win game. Ross county will have to endure the tough test of Rangers at home.</p><p>Report by Matt Green. </p>",

      "html": "<p>To stage a play in six varying locations, between African nations and the UK with a single connecting thread that is the space of a local barbershop seems like a huge feat for any show, in any context - yet it is one that writer Inua Ellams does effortlessly. </p><p>At its heart, the play is one that is bigger then what it immediately presents itself as. As a black woman who does their own hair, I have to admit that I am a stranger to barber shops but not necessarily what that experience is amongst the young black men that I grew up around. So to be invited on stage before the show  to sit in the barber chair, speak to Mo (who plays Samuel) as he acted out giving me a quick trim was a fresh and enticing way to set up the performance we were about to see. </p><p>The actors flowed in to their different characters with as much ease as they transitioned into completely different time zones within the play. The characters were vibrant, fully realised and this was seen in the way that each actor played them. Their naturalness in their roles made it east for the audience to believe how a joke at the beginning of a conversation (like the playful disrespect a barber feels knowing that his client had gone to another barber instead of him) could turn into something a lot more serious moments later, delving into unexpected realms for a play which presents itself more as a comedy. With all of this happening in the the humble process of getting a 5-10 minute haircut.</p><p>Ellams and the cast have invited us into a world which some of us may have only heard of and some would never personally experience. Through his ability to beautifully tell this story with an infectious energy and humorous flair, it is definitely a play worth seeing. It has the potential to educate people on the meaning of allowing black men, young and old just to be black men in a space with others like them, where there is no judgement and a freedom to be themselves outside of the harsh pressures and stereotypes that are placed on them in the world today. Yet, at the same time being relatable, showing that the basic human fundamentals of life are still discussed and felt (feeling the absence of loved ones or even sharing a joke that would still be the same, funny joke no matter how it is told or by whom) when a group people get together, outwith race and/or gender. For those who know of this experience, it affirms the sense of community that people who have lived in those experiences giving a renewed sense of appreciation for these places and their value. For me personally, with a barber shop in Peckham as the hub of interconnectedness for the narrative, it reminded me of home and the young black men that I grew up with who told me that they were off to the barbershop after college, only to come out two or three hours later...I guess after seeing this play, I find it funny to now know why. </p><p><em>The Barber Shop Chronicles runs at the Lyceum Theatre until 8 November 2019. </em></p>",

      "title": "Cigarettes After Sex – Cry Album Review",
      "html": "<p><strong>Cigarettes After Sex</strong>’s sophomore effort is a vulnerable and cinematic collection of songs about love, lust, and complicated relationships.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/2019/10/Cigarettes-After-Sex.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>“<strong>Cigarettes After Sex</strong>” seems like a very particular, yet perfect name for the dream pop band whose sound is more mesmerizing than ever on <em><strong>Cry</strong></em>, the follow-up to their self-titled debut.</p><p>Frontman Greg Gonzalez wrote the album as a film about romance, beauty and sexuality, and ‘Don’t Let Me Go’ is the perfect “first scene”. The nostalgic track sees the singer longing for a relationship that is long-lost with a person he is still very much in love with; on the chorus he sings “Come to me now / Don’t let me go / Stay by my side”. It is almost ironic, yet perfectly fitting that the band’s second album would start with a song about a past lover who is impossible to get over.</p><p>The theme of unequal love is omnipresent on the album. In fact, the second track ‘Kiss It off Me’ is about exactly that, a unilateral relationship that finds the singer deeply in love with a partner who seems more into other men (“Could you love me instead / Of all the boyfriends you got?”) but is not ready to give up on the pair’s sexual encounters (“Said \"It’s a bad time\" but you just can’t quit”). On the chorus, Gonzalez is powerless and asks his partner to “Kiss it off [him]”, as the eventual heartbreak seems unavoidable.</p><p>‘Heavenly’, the lead single and third track of the album is slightly more uptempo and sounds as dreamy as you would expect. However, the title is clearly about more than just sonics, and is the perfect adjective to describe the singer’s emotions on the song. Although <em>Cry</em> is compared to a film, this track feels more like a painting, fittingly titled <em>Heavenly</em>, as Gonzalez depicts a wonderful moment of intimacy where he is “Giving all [his] love” to his partner. ‘Heavenly’ leaves the listener to wonder whether the singer’s feelings are reciprocated or not, but for the first time on this album, the present is all that matters, as context is hardly important when looking at a masterpiece.</p><p>After telling his lover ‘You’re the Only Good Thing in My Life’, the singer comes back to earth and has to deal with complications in his relationship yet again on ‘Touch’. Here context would be welcome, but the singer lets his listener guess what he – or his character – has done, leaving him remorseful and his partner heartbroken. The flawless depiction of the pair’s emotional turmoil and need for each other’s ‘Touch’ is another testament to Greg Gonzalez’s beautifully relatable songwriting abilities.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lY3g3h0iP3A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>The sixth track feels like a trip out the real world. Appropriately titled ‘Hentai’ – the overly sexual subgenre of manga –, the record mentions a fortune-telling fantasy character (“About a girl who as soon as she made you cum / Would show you the future”), argues dying “in an airplane crash / Over the ocean” would be “romantic” and draws an animated version of the featured love interest (“Beautiful hearts are in your eyes”). But aside from all the fictional images, the singer’s trip is punctuated by – and ends with a simple and honest chorus (“I’ve been waiting for you to fall for me / And let me in your life / I’ve been waiting for you”).</p><p>The title track sees Cigarette After Sex’s frontman on the other side of an unbalanced relationship, as he cannot faithfully commit to the lyrics’ recipient and warns them about the painful end to their story (“My heart just can’t be faithful for long / I swear I’ll only make you cry). While the singer’s mentioned faithfulness seems emotional rather than plainly sexual, ‘Cry’ does remind the listener of ‘Touch’, this plays into the wider and consistent theme of the album. The contrast between the narrator’s points of view of in ‘Cry’ and ‘Kiss it Off Me” is very interesting to point out and gives a more complex flow to the album’s “script”.</p><p>‘Falling in Love’, second to last song on the tracklist, conveniently tells the story of two people in the early stages of a relationship. This is probably the most hopeful songwriting you will find on <em>Cry</em> and a beautiful predecessor to the album’s conclusion. The aforementioned outro is another example of perfectly yet ironically named records; despite the very erotic content, its lyrics do feel ‘Pure’, because the singer seems to finally be in a healthy and loving relationship.</p><p>The album ends on a way more positive note than it starts, strengthening the film comparisons. And although Gonzalez says <em>Cry</em> stitches different characters and scenes together, it does feel like the journey of a unique character who, like most real and fictional human beings, struggles with life and love. Indeed, the tale starts with unreciprocated feelings for a past love interest (‘Don’t Let Me Go’) and indecisive partner (‘Kiss It off Me’), then sees its main character going through ups (‘Heavenly’) and downs (‘Touch’, ‘Cry’), until finally feeling fulfilled and possibly happy (‘Falling In Love’, ‘Pure’), a happy ending typical of American blockbusters. Whether that was Gonzalez’s intention matters not, real art is always up for interpretation, that is what makes <em>Cry</em> such an appreciable album. Cigarettes After Sex thus cement their place in music, and more generally in art, with lyrics that can be deeply analyzed, in an age of more superficial songwriting.</p><p>Sonically the album is extremely cohesive, and takes the listener to the beaches of Mallorca, where the instrumentals were created. <em>Cry</em>’s production is undeniably dreamy and could fit a wide range of moods, during situations like a chilly winter day in or beautiful summer evening.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s1QCL9AGbO0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>",

      "title": "Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency Review",
      "html": "<p>Douglas Adams, famed for his <em>Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy </em>(1978), the iconic satirical science fiction novel every geek must have read at least twice in their lifetime (probably explaining the over 14 millions copies it sold). Nearly ten years after, Adams wrote his second novel – <em>Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency </em>(1987). Much less known, <em>Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, </em>takes its genesis from two 'Doctor Who' episodes, written by Douglas Adams himself, and classifies itself as a humorous detective, though Adams much preferred “thumping good detective-ghost-horror-who dunnit-time travel-romantic-musical-comedy-epic”. Following this last description, the play did it spot on. From Tom Hindle's (Dirk Gently) clumsy agitation to Sophie Mackay's (Rachel McDuff) confused defiance – every actor on stage fully embraces their characters' maximum dramatic capacity and manage to make every single silly joke seem hilarious. Since the play is overflowing with a wide range of them, it truly is impossible not to find anything to your liking.</p><p>The Professor of Chronology, who plays a major role in both the book and the play, is brilliantly portrayed by Leonie Findlay. Her quirkiness and facial expressions transform the character from just an ordinary person on stage to one for whom it is impossible not to have a soft spot. She appears so at ease on the stage, it wouldn't surprise me if her living-room was considered her corner on stage. Though at first the arrangement of the décor seemed a bit crammed, too messy and too disorganized to peacefully watch the play unfold. I have come to realise it was necessary for the timeline (and the alibis) of the story to make sense. These, however, only come into effect in Act II. The readers of the book (and the play's description) must have already known that at some point the play would turn into a murder mystery that needed solving from (obviously) the detective. It took however close to an hour for this revelation to take please, leaving the audience with too much time without having a clear direction to look for clues, thereby missing some essentials. After the interval the play jumps straight to the solving of the mystery without properly introducing a key element to the second act in the first act.</p><p>Once of the best parts to which I must give credit, is the projection Designer Alexander Mohan Morzeria-Davis. A necessary element for the storyline of the play, but also employed humorously as clarifications. It was also really nice to see the technical team (Technical Manager – Rhys Seeburger, and Lighting Designer – MJ Harman) at the end represented on the big screen as well. To: The Audience. Saving human race from total extinction – no charge.</p><p><em>Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency runs at the Bedlam Theatre until 26 November 2019. </em></p>",

      "title": "Judy and Punch Review",
      "html": "<p>‘Punch and Judy’ is a popular puppet show that has been performed since the 1600s. It has no fixed plot, and every puppeteer is partly free to tell their own story with it. There are two common aspects: the show follows Mr. Punch and his wife Judy, and Mr. Punch usually ends up getting into a confrontation and hitting someone with his stick.</p><p><em>Judy and Punch</em> flips the names of the couple around in its title, raising questions about the power of language. It exists on two levels-Punch and Judy are both the puppeteers and the puppets they control. The link between the two is solidified when Mr. Punch uses a stick just like his puppet in a scary, horrifying way. The film explores the active nature of stories and the way they inspire and connect to real examples of violence, especially domestic violence.</p><p>The film’s set and production design are both intriguing and self-defeating. <em>Judy and Punch </em>is set in Seaside, a village nowhere near the sea. Though IMDb says Seaside is in 17<sup>th</sup> century England, it seems to be a satirical mix of all sorts of places jumbled together, suggesting the audience focus on the ideas of the film instead of the place. The soundtrack shifts through music from around the world, the wood floor under its nooses looks like it’s from a modernist apartment in a business district, and the village looks like it’s from a live-action Disney remake of an old English fairy tale.</p><p>The film seems intentionally odd. It explores how women in Seaside were branded witches for doing absolutely everything and how men used that to their violent advantage. The film seems to fight against that male influence, allowing everything about it to be weird and wonderful. However, its tone is too imbalanced. As a revolutionary statement against male violence towards women, it is bold and liberating. As a film, it is disengaging because it doesn’t flow well. I know that it can be a frustrating experience to find something doesn’t work in an artistic medium even though its ideas seem utterly justified, and there is often no clear answer as to why something doesn’t translate to film. What I can say is that even surrealist paintings or absurdist theatre, despite their jumbled images, feel real to their audience because they connect to an emotion inside them. This film’s atmospheres are so arbitrary they lose the spark of emotional immediacy.</p><p>Even the actors seem confused about what they are trying to do here. Mia Wasikowska and Damon Herriman as Judy and Punch have so much happening on their faces that it’s hard to pick out what they’re trying to convey. Both they and the film are highly ambitious in the ideas that they are trying to explore but they haven’t adequately focused on anything.</p><p><em>Judy and Punch</em> is well-meaning but tries to do so much that none of its numerous ideas are powerfully expressed. I would, however, recommend it for the inkling of freedom it gives you afterwards.</p><p><em>Judy and Punch opens in UK cinemas on 22 November 2019. Reviewed at the Cameo Cinema, Edinburgh.</em></p>",

      "title": "Big Thief- Two Hands Album Review",
      "html": "<p>It’s scientifically proven that one of the boldest moves for an artist to attempt is to follow up an excellent, universally acclaimed full length album with another full length release in the same year. It has been done less frequently in recent years, but when artists manage to pull off two great albums in the same year, it’s a consistently impressive feat. <em>Two Hands</em> is American folk-rock outfit, Big Thief's attempt at this milestone, coming less than six months after their previous album, <em>U.F.O.F</em>. It is a collection of mostly electric songs, recorded almost entirely live, and is composed of a mix of brand new tracks and fan-tested staples of their live show. <em>Two Hands </em>shows the band in a different mode than displayed in <em>U.F.O.F.</em>, and mostly succeeds as both a stand-alone album and as a companion piece.<br></p><p>It was tempting to hastily derive a narrative for the album and the band’s trajectory after the lead single ‘Not’ came out in August. While the band had dabbled in fuzzed-out rock before, particularly on their debut Masterpiece, never had it been as unhinged, ferocious, and snarling as it was on ‘Not’. Upon hearing it, I extrapolated and assumed that <em>Two Hands</em> must be their rock album to set right their balance after <em>U.F.O.F.</em> veered further into atmospheric folk territory than any previous release. <br></p><p><em>Two Hands</em> is definitely more of a rock record than <em>U.F.O.F</em>., though the rest of the album is more in line with their established blend of folk and indie rock than the departure into blistering chaos that ‘Not’ might suggest. The second single, ‘Forgotten Eyes’, is more representative of the album’s sound: relaxed, spontaneous, and a blend of loose and meticulous, the sound of prodigious, Berklee College of Music trained instrumentalists jamming together. As opposed to much of <em>U.F.O.F.</em> which thrived by describing minute, vivid details, ‘Forgotten Eyes’ takes a more macro focus, with its chorus of “The wound has no direction. Everybody needs a home and deserves protection” advocating for universal empathy and basic human rights.<br></p><p>The album succeeds the most in its more upbeat numbers, particularly when it dives into newer territory for them. The title track is a highlight, propelled by layered, intricate guitar arpeggios and skittering percussion. ‘Shoulders’ comes the closest to matching the unbridled fury of ‘Not’ with an explosive chorus featuring macabre lyrics like “and the blood of the man who kills my mother in his hand is in me.” It’s one of lead singer Adrianne Lenker’s most expressive and tortured vocal performances to date.<br></p><p>The mellower songs are more of a mixed bag. Intro, ‘Rock and Sing’ is a brief, gorgeous song built around a tender descending guitar riff, kind of like if Big Thief was commissioned to compose a lullaby. ‘Those Girls’ comes to life late in the song, as bassist Max Oleartchik gets a time to shine with some up-the-neck runs over an instrumental passage. The closing sequence from ‘Replaced’ to ‘Cut my Hair’ is made up of three pretty, stand-alone songs which blend together to their slight detriment when listened to in order. Overall the quieter moments are more direct than they are on<em> U.F.O.F.</em> In the former they are shrouded in ethereal arrangements and often sounds like Big Thief are playing behind a thick layer of translucent fog; here, for better or for worse, it sounds like they’re right in front of you, and when Lenker requests “please, cut my hair,” it reads like an earnest invitation.<br></p><p>Releasing two albums in one year, while impressive, also makes reviewing the second one a little unfair. In this case, it makes <em>Two Hands</em> hard to separate from the context and shadow of <em>U.F.O.F.</em>, which is still Big Thief’s boldest, most cohesive statement to date. However, <em>Two Hands</em> is much more than an afterthought, more than a series of songs that didn’t make the cut onto <em>U.F.O.F.</em> It’s a looser, simpler, louder statement that covers some new ground for the band, and some familiar territory with a new degree of directness and spontaneity. Overall it’s not the group’s most consistent album, but the highlights are as essential and daring as anything they’ve done.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" title=\"Spotify Embed: Two Hands\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7pg8T6pajjHVZbiyB8bGxo\"></iframe></figure>",

      "html": "<p>As the leaves turn more fiery red, the daylight more bleak and opaque, and the darkest day of the year draws near – I feel in my bones it is time to pull out the classics of the Gothic and Romantic novels and revel in the pure wildness of nature and raw emotion. To mix up my tenth rereading of Mary Shelley's <em>Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus, </em>this year I went with great excitement to Rona Munro's adaptation - 'Frankenstein'. The play starts in the traditional way – icebergs, strong manly characters with decision-making skills, a scarcely dressed guy running impressively over the ice, and Mary Shelley crashing into the scene exclaiming it's all not going to work. One moment we've transported ourselves to the world of the imagined play, the next Eilidh Loan (Mary Shelley) demands our attention back to her struggling to write down the scene which will start it all. Increasingly impatient, frantic, and snappy Eilidh perfectly delivers the comments we've all been secretly muttering under our breaths while reading the novel. These little insertions transform the formal language of polished up script into a dialogue between Shelley as an author and the family of characters she creates.</p><p>The interplay between Ben Castle-Gibb (Frankenstein), Michael Moreland  (The Monster) and Eilidh Loan (Mary Shelley) is so well done it is at times hard to tell who is the puppet, the puppeteer, or even a projection of the author herself. All the main themes of the Romantics and the Gothic novel are touched upon, even if it is to critique that Frankenstein has to be “such a great hero!”. Special attention has to be given to Natali McCleary (Elizabeth/Safie) who manages to turn a dreary regular portrayal of the passive female into a strong woman who stands out from the pages and shows how strong the power of love can make one. The lighting and décor (Grant Anderson – Lighting Design; Becky Minto – Set and Costume Designer) allows for the characters, and especially Mary Shelley, to walk freely between imagined locations – and even between imagination and the 'real' world. Though Rona Munro has asserted in an interview with Dave Pollock that “you terrify people with ideas, not with effect” it surely is the stunning effects that gives us just that tiny impulse of something supra human in the air.</p><p>Though during Act I I wasn't entirely sure how Act II would develop, nearing the end I started to realise that because of Rona Munro's retelling, the book itself started to make even more sense now. All the events written down by Shelley are slowly taking it's toll and with equal pride and disgust she declares that her work here is done now. Closing her notebook and with gleaming eyes – she appears to throw the Monster at the audience and orders it to -</p><p>“Live!</p><p>Live!</p><p>Live!”</p><p><em>Run ended.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>Eric Arthur Blair, better known as George Orwell, was an inimitable story writer. And following his father’s footsteps, Richard Blair, is a compelling storyteller.</p><p>In a mere sixty minutes, Blair takes the audience on a whistle-stop tour of his father’s life. For the Orwell novice, none of the important, overarching details are spared. From the author’s birth in 1903, to his public school education, and service in Burma; from his ‘tramping’ days as a ‘down and out’ in Paris and London, to his service for the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, and his time writing on the Scottish island of Jura in the 1940s.</p><p>Between breaths, Blair reveals some more personal anecdotes, including tales of Orwell’s biting wit and sarcasm. His story is visualised through a collection of photographs. The most insightful is that of Orwell’s original manuscript of <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>, the facisimile of which you can now purchase online. Consisting of little more than a few sentences, Orwell still rigorously drafted and redrafted the now-infamous opening paragraph. On the surface, the image depicts nothing more than a series of scribbles and crossings-out. However, it represents the author’s concise and meticulous style – which has always drawn, and continues to draw, me to his wide variety of works.</p><p>However, its concision was perhaps my disappointment of this event. Already familiar with Orwell’s general timeline, I craved more of these intimate stories and details. Blair himself was only five years old at the time of Orwell’s death, and his insights were generally drawn from secondary sources. Though compellingly told, I found the stories and images little personal compensation for the fact that no recordings of Orwell’s voice from his BBC days have been found. Afterwards, Blair informed me that the magnetic strip tapes aged poorly, and so these recordings will likely never be recovered.</p><p>Thus, we’re left only with Orwell’s written word. And fortunately, whether essays or poems, articles or novels, they themselves are deeply saturated with his own style and stories.</p><p><em>Part of the Scottish International Storytelling Festival 2019 (18 October - 31 October).</em></p><p><em>Run ended.</em></p>",

      "title": "Foals - Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part 2 Album Review",
      "html": "<p><em>Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part 2</em>: Foals fall short of making something really interesting.</p><p>Before <em>Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part 1</em> was released earlier this year, it had been 4 years since we’d received a new Foals album. Foals have been on a fast track to critical acclaim, and mass appeal for years, with huge hits like ‘Mountain at My Gates’, and ‘My Number’. But as their appeal widens, does their sound get watered down?</p><p><em>Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part 2 </em>kicks off with ‘Red Desert’, an instrumental piece, which ends with a little Indian-sounding coda (a style which never returns). The next track ‘The Runner’ features a back-and-forth between singer Yannis and a Chris Martin sound-alike. I really enjoy these first 3 songs, it builds up nicely and I think they have a great groove to them, whilst not compromising on the catchy hooks which are some of the highlights of their best tracks.</p><p>But then the album transfers to a more aggressive tone with songs like ‘Black Bull’ and ‘Like Lightning’, the former of which starts of promisingly, however just doesn’t go anywhere. It’s meant to be this edgy, hard song, with Yannis shouting throughout, but it just fails to bring out any emotion whatsoever from me. He shrieks in the chorus: “uhhh ohhh we not playing around, I got a black bull in town”, probably my least favourite line on the entire project. It doesn’t get any better in ‘Like Lightning’. These two songs feel like they were written especially to be put on movie trailers, in the style of Royal Blood. There’s basically no variation of dynamics, no meaning, just a long stream of sound that hopefully some advertising company will cut up, and Foals can scoop up the royalties.</p><p>Foals proceeds to take a break with ‘Ikaria’, a short piano interlude, which unlike ‘Red Dessert’ doesn’t link musically in to anything. Yannis calls this song some ‘Breathing Room’ for the record, the title in reference to the Greek story of Icarus, which gets explored further in the next track ‘10,000 Feet’ which returns more to form of the first couple of tracks. I think this is lyrically the highlight of the album. Yannis creates some beautiful and vivid imagery, “Burning star about to come again, cool green water, come and mend”.</p><p>If you haven’t fallen asleep from listening ‘Into the Surf’, you get to the final song. A 10 minute epic called ‘Neptune’, which is far from epic. It’s long, drags and fails to say anything about anything. “I’m on my knees, I’m singing, please” says Yannis, as the cliché counter goes up. It ends with a cool synth sound, which would have been nice to hear during the song rather than surgically attached to the end.</p><p>Foals try to explore many different avenues with this album. They want to be mysterious atmospheric rockers, with interludes, 10 minute long songs, and vocals drenched in reverb. They also want to be edgy punks, with distorted riffs and angsty screaming, however they fail to pull off either of these styles even somewhat convincingly. They instead end up producing a lukewarm, passionless mix. As if a bunch of genres were placed into a blender and decimated to create a more palatable mush for the masses.</p><p>The guitars are forgetful, the vocals are stale, the drums perform the bare minimum throughout. The worst part is I know Foals can create really passionate, original music. I have adored their debut album Antidotes for years. It’s so exciting and features every member of the band really putting everything they got on the table. Even with more simplistic, minimalistic songs, they create a lot more intriguing sounds, and Yannis says twice as much with probably half of the vocabulary. You can witness moments of Foals’ greatness on this album, in the first 3 tracks, and in ’10,000 Feet’, but these moments are short lived, and I wouldn’t maintain much hope of them getting any more frequent.</p><p>It hits all the points of a critically acclaimed rock-band album, however fails to surpass these in any direction, instead choosing to stay right in the middle, which will be perfect for some people, but not for me.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" title=\"Spotify Embed: Part 2 Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2gA6WSERaJVOWwuB0hegvp\"></iframe></figure>",

      "html": "<p><em>Corryvreckan</em> is an unexpected gem. Nestled just off the Royal Mile in the intimate Netherbow Theatre, the captivating Fiona Herbert weaves the audience in a shroud of myth, imagination and music.</p><p>Having never experienced live storytelling before, I was unsure what to expect; prior to the start of the show, the audience were invited to switch off from the outside world and use our imaginations - an invitation warmly accepted by all.</p><p>Herbert tells first of a chance encounter with Richard Blair, son of George Orwell, when on a boat trip to the Corryvreckan whirlpool, just off the west coast of Scotland, and how this prompted her to fashion a retelling of the plethora of myths that surround it.</p><p>For an audience member approaching the piece with no prior knowledge of the surrounding mythology of Corryvreckan, I feel some context for a number of the tales would have increased their value and allowed the audience to better follow their train. This, however, is not to the discredit of Herbert, who capably creates a range of characters with her body and voice, complemented by imaginative and poetic language. Her retelling places a decidedly witty and female twist on myths which seem to favour the male perspective in their original form; thankfully, however, this never feels overworked or forced, as retellings of folk tales often risk falling into.</p><p>One of the highlights was the final tale of the Kelpie and his entrapment of various mortals in Corryvreckan; this section seemed the most polished and was accompanied by the most accomplished lighting and sound offered by the production. Overall, more regular and uniform use of lighting and sound would have added the depth and drama which this final tale achieved, but there was a pleasing use of tech for a production of this kind.</p><p>The musical accompaniment provided by Sarah McFadgen was hypnotic in its beauty. She played gently on the violin as we entered the auditorium and added moments of light and shade to the tales with her accompaniment, captivating the audience with her renditions of folk ballads, which truly help bring the tales to life in the mind. I only wish there had been more of it.</p><p>If live storytelling sounds intimidating, or odd, I can only say this: go and try it for yourselves. Expect to be challenged and to use your imagination but the result can be captivating and you may surprise yourself.</p><p><em>Part of the Scottish International Storytelling Festival 2019 (18 October - 31 October).</em></p><p><em>Run ended.</em></p>",

There’s a particularly enjoyable (or, more precisely, familiar) and inimitable<em> Britishness</em> throughout. That is easy, I could write about that happily.</p><p>It is the subject matter that is difficult. A deeply moral quandary about a sacrifice made to expose the truth for public knowledge. I feel as if I should be talking about it- that <em>everyone</em> should be talking about it. That is the impression I was left with. <em>Official Secrets</em> is an exceptional political thriller, at a time where all politics could classify as thriller-worthy. This is the true story of whistleblower Katharine Gun.</p><p>Katharine Gun is a 27-year-old junior analyst at GCHQ, working as a translator. Her life is seemingly normal (save for the fact that she is at the epicentre of British intelligence). She lives in Cheltenham with her husband, Yasser. It’s the early 2000s and Tony Blair is prime minister. There are various clips of Blair and Bush peppered throughout the film and the Iraqi war is high on everyone’s radar. It’s clear that there is strong opposition to war in Britain.</p><p>Katharine exposes a memo from the US National Security Agency enlisting the help of British intelligence to collect information on U.N. Security Council members to swing a crucial vote on the invasion of Iraq. In doing so, she breaches the Official Secrets Act.</p><p>The aftermath of this decisions is truly gripping, and Katharine’s personal and legal struggles are compelling told. To what extent is a job a job, removed from one’s own personal and moral sensibilities? How far should one go for the sake of public knowledge?</p><p>Katharine Gun (Kiera Knightley) and Ben Emmerson (Ralph Fiennes) are staggeringly portrayed, and there is a particular warmth to their character’s interaction in court. The film ends on a staggering note, and I leave the cinema to collect my thoughts- only to find that the questions raised go far beyond of an afternoon screening.</p><p><em>Official Secrets is in cinemas now.</em></p><p><em>Reviewed as Film of the Week, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CameoCinema/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAKPislawMGrxiIlOlKYIP0GVXzfAUHgmBMjXHmpalXq5DqZ0ekPOKWkVhdpl0anMOypoM_ffelobqg&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3m5rVwBfwOJBI9lTeXSVSV4IYSi-mkvNZrxLjX3sf9xQMBIfwQHqmnOVhTFYMde1OP-K_JXHjoyELZdbrRqQDXdlHV7H5DG6KX3FTQ1Fzhb3w-GoG7ijjb_l1NfYC7DJv3itREpuLqx53UleCbHFCPh1eylwt12_xPafkq3MvN_UySxZGvJea5I8ZySnFlrWmbaCut5-8BkE3Ga1Ro4DBM_S-mnuCuqcAOjZTcwpJqLTYt5CiI89TWL2qeKxQIcA6kU0MUg_evAWOWlP6z0X2xgsM-IjI0zCr9irfz-vyW5yJGaFEwKoHbNAOIRGXXX4EEs4yA24RniNW96daiVU\">Cameo Cinema</a>, Edinburgh.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>Following its world premiere at the Edinburgh International Festival and subsequent tour of Scotland, Scottish Ballet’s production of <em>The Crucible</em> returns to Edinburgh’s Festival Theatre for its final performances before crossing over to Washington, D.C. for an American run.</p><p>Based on Arthur Miller’s celebrated 1953 play, itself inspired by the Salem witch trials of 1692-3, <em>The Crucible</em> is an explosive and immensely enjoyable new ballet that has the potential to become a modern classic. This production plunges us right into the heart of the action that takes place off stage in Miller’s play, depicting Abigail, a young girl on the verge of womanhood, and her sexual encounter with John Proctor, her employer. When John’s wife Elizabeth catches them, a hurt Abigail seeks a way to curse her, and soon she and her friends become embroiled in a spiral of accusations of witchcraft over which they quickly lose control.</p><p>The original play, with its focus on the hysteria and subsequent tragedy essentially caused by life under the constraints of an authoritarian regime, was written as an allegory for McCarthyism. Bearing this political subtext and the play’s penchant for heavy dialogue in mind, it could easily be seen by many as a surprising choice for a ballet. However, thanks to Helen Pickett’s seamless choreography and Peter Salem’s haunting score, any fears are quickly allayed. In the hands of Scottish Ballet, <em>The Crucible </em>translates beautifully to the medium of dance. The choreography is cleverly synchronised to the music, ranging in style from more classical and lyrical sequences to contemporary ones accompanied by a modern soundtrack. The dancers, in particular Constance Devernay (Abigail), Barnaby Rook-Bishop (John Proctor) and Bethany Kingsley-Garner (Elizabeth Proctor), effortlessly portray the nuances of the original play’s meaty dialogue through their expressive movement – indeed, especially during the sequences between John and Elizabeth, we are able to interpret the course of their conversation through their bodies just as easily as if it were through words. David Flynn and Emma Kingbury’s minimalistic set design is effective throughout, most notably in the final moments of the production, where it perfectly complements the dramatic end.</p><p>This production is the first of Scottish Ballet’s ‘Five in Five’, during which they plan to stage five new full-length ballets as part of their 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations. If <em>The Crucible</em> is anything to go by, then the following instalments of ‘Five in Five’ will be unmissable.</p><p><em>Scottish Ballet: The Crucible runs at the Festival Theatre until Friday 18 October 2019.</em></p>",

The play is sold out. While we quickly find our seats at doors open, I find I'm excited to see what kind of surreality I might experience in the next hour and fifteen minutes. Surprisingly recognizable, the play is captivating from the first scene.</p><p>Lizzie Lewis (Sophie) and Hannah Churchill (Joanna) act out most of the one part play directly speaking towards the audience. Sophie's piercing look and measured speech, together with Hannah's innocent eager manner and tendency to overshare makes us forget for a brief moment that there exists another world but theirs. Both tell their stories of loneliness and unease of their place in the world, until Sophie sends her downstairs neighbour a package – allowing her to be viewed on the baby monitor. Though they don't meet (yet), their relationship continues to grow and in their monologues we hear how similar these complete strangers in fact are. Their on screen shared lives come to a crashing close when Sophie is forced to rely on Joanna for support, but are some relationships meant to be working in their different environments?</p><p>Though dealing with a serious, voyeuristic, at times bordering on a stalkerish situation, the two women deliver their lines in a calm consistent manner that is jam-packed with humorous, modern, and very recognizable lines. The fact that, diverging from Phil Porter's original play (<em>BLINK</em>, 2018), the main couple is a same-sex female one only adds more to the narrative. It adds an air of unpredictability to the play as well, a romantic outcome is less presumed. As added benefit Joanna is less of a voyeuristic character, stepping out of the stereotypical representation of the loner man observing a seemingly unaware woman. By stripping away social conventions and stereotypically cast characters, the viewer can interpret their monologues in any way relatable to the viewer's own life. The uniform set up of the décor, as well as the white clothing help the viewer to imagine it is not just Sophie and Joanna up on the stage – it could be any one of our neighbours or Facebook friends. Love can indeed be whatever you feel it to be.</p><p><em>Run ended.</em></p>",

      "title": "Ariana Grande at The SSE Hydro, Glasgow",
      "html": "<p>After releasing not one, but two record-breaking bodies of work in less than a year, and reaching new heights in her career — such as joining The Beatles as the only acts to ever occupy the top three positions on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, American pop artist <strong>Ariana Grande</strong> embarked on the '<strong>Sweetener World Tour</strong>' to further promote her fourth studio album <em>Sweetener</em> (2018) and its follow-up <em>thank u, next</em> (2019).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/2019/10/Sweetener-Tour-Picture-2-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The European leg of the tour started in London, on August 17th; and exactly one month later, Grande takes the stage at the SSE Hydro in <strong>Glasgow</strong> for her first show in Scotland since 2015's 'Honeymoon Tour'.</p><p>The concert starts with ‘Boyfriend’ collaborators <strong>Social House</strong>. Grande’s biggest supporters know the R&amp;B/Pop duo as two of her closest friends, but most spectators have probably not heard their debut EP 'Everything Changed...'. Of course, that does not stop Mikey and Scootie from delivering a highly energetic performance of several songs from the project including standout track ‘Tropical Rain’ with nothing but two microphones and a backpack. Their enthusiasm is very contagious, and they applaud their audience for singing along to hit single ‘Magic in the Hamptons’. But the best part of Social House’s set is undeniably the final one, a chilling performance of ‘Haunt You’, accompanied by thousands of flashlights moving in harmony to the American duo’s dreamy vocals.</p><p>Next up is English singer <strong>Ella Mai</strong>. The R&amp;B singer and her band perform tracks from her self-titled debut album and deliver a beautiful rendition of her Ed Sheeran collaboration ‘Put It All On Me’, that arguably surpasses the studio version. Much like Social House, Mai conquers the hearts of the audience with smooth deep cuts like ‘10,000 Hours’ and ‘Naked’, as well as Grammy winning song ‘Boo’d Up’ and concludes an undeniably great set with her hit single ‘Trip’.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZoiL_My3RV0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>After two amazing support acts, the public’s excitement is at its peak, and as the big screen lights up and sets the mood, the screams intensify until <strong>Ariana Grande</strong>’s voice is finally heard, singing ‘raindrops’ from below the stage. The opening track sets the tone for a night of impressive vocals, Grande’s biggest asset, which she effortlessly showcases on controversial and critically acclaimed hit ‘God is a woman’ before the ambiance darkens for a mysterious and sensual choreographed performance of ‘bad idea’ and ‘break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored’.</p><p>After a heartwarming interlude of videos from Ariana’s childhood, the megastar returns to the stage with an act full of fan-favourite tracks. Fans sing along to ‘R.E.M’ (“excuse me umm… I love you”) and some even execute the choreography to ‘Be Alright’. Grande proceeds to showcase her rap skills on Nicki Minaj’s verse from their international hit ‘Side to Side’ and her sassy-savage attitude on US &amp; UK chart topping single ‘7 rings’.</p><p>Eye-grabbing visuals accompany the next interlude ‘Adore’, and Ariana returns for the most emotional part of the night with songs like ‘Love Me Harder’ and ‘fake smile’. But the real highlight here is her incredible performance of ‘breathin’, a radio hit about Grande’s anxiety following the tragic terrorist attack that occurred after her concert in Manchester, in 2017. The vulnerable lyrics coupled with the singer’s jaw-dropping vocals give the show its most powerful moment. Grande then proceeds to apply lipstick while singing the comedic lyrics to ‘make up’ and satisfies her nostalgic supporters with a medley of her early R&amp;B tracks. The set ends with a moon-like sphere coming from the ceiling to accompany the space-themed anthem ‘NASA’ and the fan-favourite ballad ‘Only 1’, the scene feels like a dream.</p><p>The stage production and lighting keep getting better in the fourth act with two standout tracks from Grammy winning album <em>Sweetener</em>, Ariana delivers astonishing high notes on ‘everytime’ and trippy vibes for ‘the light is coming’. The audience then sings and dances along to 2016’s highly acclaimed ‘Into You’. This set is followed by yet another video interlude, this time of Grande covering ‘My Heart Belongs to Daddy’, nailing the Marilyn Monroe aesthetics. During her last act Grande goes all out, with another impressive performance of career defining hit ‘Dangerous Woman’, an homage to her LGBTQ+ friends and fans with pride anthem ‘Break Free’ and a beautiful rendition of 2018 comeback single ‘No Tears Left To Cry’. The public’s excitement is unmatched, and Ariana exists the stage. The encore is followed by a video, featuring some of the singer’s recent achievements and photos taken with her friends, that introduces the last song of the night, Grande’s massively successful positive break-up anthem ‘thank u, next’ which concludes the show on a lighthearted note that perfectly communicates Ariana’s love and devotion to her friends and fanbase.</p><p>Overall Grande clearly does not disappoint. With an impressive catalogue, unbelievable vocals, extremely professional and well thought off stage production and lighting, and most importantly undeniable love for her craft and her supporters, Ariana Grande proves she is deserving of her massive success and her title as this generation’s princess of pop.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYh6mYIJG2Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>",

      "title": "Gauguin at the National Gallery Review",
      "html": "<p>IMAGE:  ‘VISION OF THE SERMON (JACOB WRESTLING WITH THE ANGEL)' (1888)</p><p><em>Gauguin at the National Gallery </em>is a unique cinematic event – a sixty-minute documentary about the painter Paul Gauguin, followed by an exclusive private viewing of the National Gallery exhibition, <em>Gauguin Portraits</em>. Created by the Gallery for those of us outside of London, the very fact that this film exists is a positive effort in broadening access to the arts.</p><p>The film explores his unique legacy, both in terms of post-impressionist art history, and through the lens of social power hierarchies of gender and nineteenth-century French colonialism. Despite his international pre-eminence, Gauguin – and his art - have been problematised for his sexualised representations of teenage Polynesian girls, including his thirteen or fourteen-year-old ‘wife’ Teha’amana. <em>Gauguin at the National Gallery</em> openly explores these issues, in part through interviews with the descendants of Gauguin’s European and Polynesian relations. Instead of discrediting his art entirely, this perhaps reinforces the value of his work today – as historical artefacts, depicting the filtered, and sometimes fictionalised, representations of Polynesia through the European colonists’ eyes.</p><p>In just sixty minutes, the documentary covers remarkable ground and depth in the life of the artist. One of the most widely travelled of his contemporaries, Gauguin is best-known for his works from Tahiti and the Marquesas Islands. Yet, the details of his European artistic exploits – including his brief time at Van Gogh’s Yellow House in Arles - equally illuminate his difficult character. I would argue that his attitudes and artworks were defined by two obsessions – to become the ‘savage outsider’, and simultaneously, the ‘cultish leader’.</p><p>Exhibition co-curator Christopher Riopelle dissects the painting ‘Vision of the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel)’ (1888) – which is currently on display in the Scottish National Gallery. Despite its overt biblical context, I find the piece embodies many facets of Gauguin’s own character and artistic approach. Aesthetically, the use of bright colours and a stylistically Japanese tree represents his burgeoning interest in decorative, non-naturalistic forms, developed during his time in Brittany. The depiction of Jacob and the angel wrestling draws upon the tradition of Breton wrestling, in which a cow (a non-traditional element, featured in the corner of the piece) is given as a prize. The painting also features Breton women in traditional dress, perhaps exemplary of Gauguin’s tendency to romanticise and essentialise women in his works. Indeed, Gauguin himself features as the priest – the principled judge over proceedings. This divine association is no mere token – throughout his self-portraits, Gauguin most frequently depicted himself as Christ, suffering for his art.</p><p>The artist’s life was riddled with contradiction. Gauguin flaunted his artistic status and privilege, to receive government funding for his ‘back to nature’ trips to the Polynesian islands. He romanticised that he could self-suffice in the Tahitian nature, but ended up surviving on tinned sardines and French brandy. I left the screening with even more contempt for the individual, and yet greater historical interest in his life and works - as aesthetic artefacts of colonial and gendered hierarchies, which still resonate today.</p><p><em>Gauguin at the National Gallery is in cinemas now. Reviewed at the Cameo Cinema, Edinburgh.</em></p><p><em>Gauguin Portraits runs at the National Gallery until 26 January 2020.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>“Dear… …D …D*ckhead!”</p><p>That’s how the play starts. With a girl in a pair of adidas and a gold nameplate, looking right at the audience, and calling them a d*ckhead!</p><p>I was not quite sure what to expect with <em>Build A Rocket</em>. The name did not seem to make much sense next to the short description that accompanies it on the flyer. All I knew going in was it had done very well during the Fringe, and it was about a sixteen year old from Scarborough, who gets pregnant.</p><p>All that’s on stage when you walk in is a silver duct-taped box, surrounded by four, what essentially look like, bike parking stands, with LED lights stuck to the underside. It looks grungy and ever so slightly homemade, but don’t be fooled – the production is nothing short of absolute brilliance.</p><p>Our one-woman show is performed by the incredibly talented Serena Manteghi, who has been involved with the show on and off, for about two and a half years now. Serena is not only wonderful in the role of the protagonist, Yasmin (our pregnant 16 year old), but she also switches at the drop of the hat to play creepy men in clubs, Yasmin’s alcoholic mother, her counsellor, doctors, friends, teachers, the list goes on! Each character is distinct and separate, both in accent and mannerisms. What has the potential to be quite confusing, has only been made clearer through Manteghi’s fabulous acting.</p><p>Having said this, she cannot take all the credit! The lighting (Ben Cowens) and sound (Simon Slater) are both completely integral to the show; yet, they are so seamlessly co-ordinated with the action on stage that one only subconsciously clocks them, if at all. The play has a somewhat scattered feel with the chronology, flickering back and forth between flashbacks, and through montages. As great as Manteghi is with the physical demands of this, there is only so much that one girl can do! At these points, the changes in lighting, from reds to a piercing white, and music, from rap, to eerie discord, all perfectly timed with Manteghi’s change in body language or character, unobtrusively aid the audience in understanding what is happening on stage, giving the play an almost movie-like quality.</p><p>So why is it half a star short of perfection? I have the tiniest niggle: some of the jokes are very Scarborough-specific, and whilst you do understand them, the full effects are sadly somewhat lost on a non-Scarborough audience. However, I still loved it!</p><p>The flyer says <em>Build A Rocket</em> is about ‘triumph over adversity,’ – and it is, but I would say it’s about so much more than that! It’s about growing up, and our teenage naïveté, our first love, and first heartbreak, both the strength and burden of being a woman, and the happiness and sorrows of being a mother. Yes, it’s about a sixteen year old from Scarborough, but it’s a story with which we can all identify. I couldn’t recommend watching it more!</p><p><em>Build A Rocket runs at the Traverse Theatre until 17 October 2019. </em></p>",

      "html": "<p>There is something about the mysteriousness of the past, that makes the historical novel a perfect base to bring our imagination to life on the stage. And sometimes we should just accept, that the best re-enactments of the past are perhaps just because they take place in our imagination. </p><p>Hattie Naylor's theatre adaptation of Sarah Water's novel <em>The Night Watch</em> draws a fine line between artistic freedom to diverge from the original novel to make it truly viable for a different from of media, and following the original script of the book as if it were the bible. Leaving it up to a magnificent creative team, in particular Nic Farman (Lighting Designer) and Max Pappenheim (Sound Designer) to skilfully transport the audience's view (and attention) from their day-to-day life to the realities of a post-war Britain. </p><p>With a flickering and buzzing, it seems as if all the fuses in the theatre hall have given up the ghost. The year is 1947. Through the guiding beams of searchlights and lamps, the viewer is left to frantically search for these ghosts in order to regain illumination. The first part of the play starts off with a loose introduction of the five main characters, although their relation to each other is quite clumsily stated, it is their interconnectedness that leaves the viewer wondering what the story is heading towards. </p><p>Dialogue follows upon dry dialogue and although Florence Roberts (Helen) and Phoebe Pryce (Kay) deliver their lines with a wealth of physical emotion and power, they do not seem to be able to drag the lines out of their stiff form and transform the script in a genuine real conversation. The beautiful set, created by David Woodhead, became a distraction, as it was constantly rearranged.  Though the scenes transit smoothly into each other, some repetitions which might work more easily in a novel (keeping in mind the longer reading time), in the play reach a point where it becomes a bit of overstating and the scene therefore too long. </p><p>What could have been a very recognisable cute caption of pure birthday bliss with your partner's presence and present, turns into a bit tacky, cheesy, and almost unbearably embarrassing lovers' play. A depiction of lesbian love in times where traditional roles where inverted yet social taboos stayed hidden, apparently means our main characters are slightly obsessed with each other, and when they lose one another they appear to lose it all. Especially the overt focus on the women's relationships with each other, makes it at times hard to discern who is in love with who, was in love with who, and who actually is who? </p><p>Unfortunately for the original novel, the topics set up in the first half of the play – an exploration of the treatment of 'pain', loss of loved ones, nostalgia for the war – are overshadowed by a Nicholas Spark's like intricate portrayal of the difficulties of love and relationship. Ironically, the play has made me eager to turn back to the pages of Sarah Water's novel which was shortlisted for the Man Booker prize, and let my imagination travel back to the past which seems indeed, more interesting than its future.</p><p><em>The Night Watch runs at King's Theatre until 19 October 2019.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>It is a rainy Sunday afternoon (as usual) while I make my way to the Usher Hall for a promising two hours of heartbreaking romance, passion, and Russian power. One of the few brownhaired persons surrounded by a sea of grey, I was prepared to sit back and relax and let the soft melodic tunes of the greatest of Russian composers wash over me. From the first few notes of Tchaikovsky's 'Romeo &amp; Juliet Fantasy Overture' (1880), a beautiful composition exploring the feuding families and the doomed love of the star-cross'd lovers, the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra steals your heart to take it on journey passed the most heartbreaking yet sensitive pieces of Russian romantic classical music. As guest of honour for this edition, the acclaimed young Romanian pianist Alexandra Dariescu enchants the audience with her performance of Rachmaninoff's 'Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Opus 18' (1901). After the final notes and applauding hands have died down, she gifts us a small piece written by a fellow countryman to warm our hearts through the interval – with genuine glee she plays us a 'Romanian Dance'<em>. </em>It won't be the last time that day the orchestra pierces our hearts with emotion and show how incredible human and sincere their perfomance is.</p><p>The Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra's ability to alternate power and passion equally comes to a galvanising close with the storming energy of Shostakovich's Tenth Symphony. Toying between piano and forte, conductor Yuri Simonov, leading the orchestra since 1998, highlights the incredible mastery of technique each musician has over their instrument. Together with brilliantly excecuted solos, the orchestra demonstrates how much of a well loved family and team they are. Even through the violence and sensitivity through which Shostakovich paints a savage portrait of Stalin and his terror, the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra manages to enthrall us with a performance that oozes human emotion. Going truly out with a bang, Yuri Simonov and his artists turn out to be a gift that keeps on giving. With every minute of applause the audience gets rewarded with more demonstration of the orchestra's musical talents. Still full of energy after having played for close to three hours (which is even one more than programmed!) they treat us – and themselves – to Shostakovich's 'Romance' from 'The Gadfly Suite'. Afterwards, the first violin signals to the conductor that they want to do another encore and we finish off an absolutely magnificent concert with Shostakovich's playful 'Polka' from the 'Age of Gold Suite'.  Now all there's left for me to say is, <em>encore!</em></p><p><em>The Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra ends their tour in the Birmingham Symphony Hall on 15 October 2019.</em></p><p><em>The Sunday Classics International Series 2019-2020 consists of seven concerts by the world's leading orchestras and soloists.

      "title": "Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds - Ghosteen Album Review",
      "html": "<p>Andrzej Caba takes a listen to Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds new album, <em>Ghosteen</em>. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/2019/10/ghosteen.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>After 40 years of making music, Nick Cave still drifts into new musical territories and creates one of his most powerful and personal albums - <em>Ghosteen. </em>In order to fully understand the grief and emotion here, it is important to know that this is the first album fully written after death of Cave’s son in 2015. Subject touched upon on his previous recording - <em>Skeleton Tree.</em>This time showing his feeling from a more personal perspective.</p><p>The change however occurred not only in Cave’s mind but also in his sound. <em>Ghosteen</em> consists of ambient-like, soft and spacious instrumentals. Beautifully crafted, mostly piano and electronic based, background serves as a base for the narrative of the album. This allows the listener to float along with the artist during his personal journey through despair but also with a weird sense of hope.</p><p>The title track is the only one that features full instrumentation with bass, drums and bells as the listeners are hit with a huge crescendo. As this happens, we are over 40 minutes into the album. For many it may be hard get through so many minimal sounds before something happens.</p><p>Throughout the album Cave touches on different aspects of mortality and faith. Something that has been present in his works since the very beginning. This time, however, it is shown from a different perspective. On the track ’Spinning Song’ he sings how his legacy will live on longer than him and he will be remembered through his music. At the end of the song Cave sings ”Peace will come” repeatedly, setting up framing device for the album. In the last song of the album - ’Hollywood’<em> </em>- Cave says he is “waiting for the peace to come”. This is a song about moving on after someone has died. He knows he has to do this even though he is not ready yet. At the same time, it seems that Nick Cave is dealing with the fact the he will die someday. On the last verse of the song, the lyrics mention Kiss Gotami. This is a direct reference to buddhism. The lesson of the Lisa Gotami story is that we have to accept our mortality and the fact that death is a universal concept concerning everyone. Approaching Kisa Gotami’s story the instrumental gets more and more unsettling and then shifts into a hating sound while Cave describes the inevitability of death.</p><p>Songs such as ’Bright Horses’<em> </em>and ’Waiting For You’<em> </em>convey hope of reuniting with his son. Cave describes life as normal, but then he realizes that it is not like this anymore and his son is not coming. This is when he shifts into matters of faith and sings about the return of Jesus. Just like Christ is supposed to return, Cave wants his son to come back.</p><p>There are a lot of references to Christian beliefs through out the album, often mixed with personal narratives of memories. Like on the song ’Sun Forest’<em>, </em>which says that despite leaving in a tough environment, we can dream and try to achieve the perfect world. Yet at the same time, Cave questions the promises of Jesus Christ, possibly explaining his lack of faith.</p><p>Ending the first part of the album, Cave reminds us that we are not alone in our grief and suffering. There are others affected by it and there are things that remind us of the people we lost. Musically, these songs are built over minimalist piano and synthesizer arrangements which allow the listener to submerge in the story and focus on the narrative. There is less vocal background instrumentation that on the rest of the album.</p><p>The first part of <em>Ghosteen</em> ends with ’Leviathan’ which closes disc one on a strong note, with Cave singing \"I love my baby and my baby loves me” over and over.</p><p>After a short moment of silence, the album shifts into part two and the already mentioned ’Ghosteen’ - the richest song on the album musically speaking. Under layers of beautiful sounds there is a lot of pain. In this song Cave directly describes his feeling towards his son’s passing trough deep, yet obvious metaphors.</p><p>Before the final song of the album there is a spoken word piece which is best described by Cave’s earlier version of the lyrics - without metaphors and any other stylistic measures. The raw version is very direct and self-explanatory. “I have found a way to write beyond the trauma, authentically, that deals with all manner of issues but does not turn its back on the issue of the death of my child. I found with some practise the imagination could propel itself beyond the personal into a state of wonder […] Here is a lyric, called Fireflies, which I wrote a few months ago that circles around this idea.”</p><p><em>Ghosteen </em>is a very heavy and powerful album. It may feel long and boring for many but this is the sound that works for the narration. It is a devastating experience. Straight forward lyrics about personal grief woven onto beautiful, ambient melodies make the listener go on a journey with Nick Cave through all of his feelings and way to overcome the despair.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M41EdpS16V0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>",

      "title": "The Panopticon Review",
      "html": "<p><strong>REVIEW BY BRONAGH GRACE</strong></p><p>Anais is fifteen years old. She has never known her parents and has spent her life in care. She arrives at the Panopticon, an institution for young offenders, in a police car, accused of an assault she denies committing. We follow her as she adapts to life in her latest institutional home, forming friendships, facing investigation and struggling to balance the trauma of her past with her efforts to survive in the present and dream of a future.</p><p>In adapting her debut novel, <em>The Panopticon</em> (2012), to stage, writer Jenni Fagan, a Granta Best Young British Novelist, and director Debbie Hannan, have succeeded in taking the many layers of a novel in which time, space and characters’ lucidity appear fragmented, and making them communicable to an audience through magnificent feats of creativity in a production that pulsates with life, even as it grapples with death.</p><p>The set looks deceptively simple: two stone statues border a row of towering panels that encircle the expanse of centre stage. A square of white light watches over everything: the only mark of an all-seeing watchtower, establishing before a single line of dialogue that in this system power claims to be all-seeing and on high. However, these panels have tricks up their sleeves, with hidden rooms facilitating movement between spaces. Meanwhile, graphics by animator Cat Bruce and video by Lewis den Hertog sees imagery from Anais’ memories, dreams and hallucinations splashed across the set; the audience is engulfed in a tide of nightmarish juxtapositions, as metaphor becomes entangled with reality.</p><p>Nevertheless, the direction draws comedy out of a plot heavy in subject matter. Anais’ happier memories and heartfelt dreams are brought to life in whimsical moments as the ensemble cast transforms the stage into a hyperbolic Parisian street or abseil in as masked reincarnations of Anais on previous misadventures. The humour has the audience on side from the outset, but also acts as a bittersweet tonic to the more hard-hitting scenes to come.</p><p>The cast captivates across the board, with rapid costume changes and a deft use of props seeing the ensemble adopt a multitude of roles. Anna Russell-Martin gives a sensational performance as the lead Anais, capturing both the grit and vulnerability of a character the audience is willing to win in a battle in which she has been cast as the underdog from birth.</p><p><em>The Panopticon</em> is not a play to see and forget. In the creativity of the production it had the audience hooked throughout, moving in time and space from the whirls of traumatised minds to the brutality of hard realities. Equally, however, Fagan’s story is unforgettable in the piercing spotlight it insists upon searing onto the cruelties inflicted upon vulnerable children in a system which it is hard to leave thinking of as anything but broken. And yet, the failings of the care system were not the echo resounding most poignantly as the sold-out audience rose to its feet. It was the strength of friendship, the dignity of resilience and the defiance of hope which this stunning play underscored most boldly.</p><p><em>The Panopticon runs at the Traverse Theatre until 19 October 2019.</em></p>",

How are things going?</strong></p><p>Good! We just got back together after a couple of weeks. We were just in Australia for a week for our first tour over there and it was amazing really. It was like nothing we had really expected. I don’t know what our expectations were but whatever they were they were surpassed. Then I spent the last two weeks doing some writing and I’ve just jumped off a plane and into a van to Dundee. We’ve just been checking out the V&amp;A museum and the Discovery.</p><p><strong>It sounds like you’re having a great time! So, you’re in Dundee tonight to play a ‘Student Takeover’ organised by the Student Radio Music Network and Amazon Music. How are you feeling about that?</strong></p><p>Yeah man, it’s cool. We love the people who’ll be dancing and making the mosh pits. Students bring the energy, that’ what it is man. Then there’s always the old people at the back who are buying the CD’s. Rock and Roll has a real mix and there’s so many people into it which is just the best.</p><p><strong>Is this your first-time playing Dundee?</strong></p><p>Yeah, yeah never played Dundee before. We can add it to the list of cities we’ve played in Scotland. We’ve played Glasgow, we’ve played Edinburgh and we’ve played PJ Malone’s in Dunfermline. The place was great. We played to about three people, but they were having a good time. Although, we were in the park beforehand and it was infested with squirrels so that’s your Dunfermline fact.</p><p><strong>You’re playing a venue tonight called The Church, which is a literal church right?</strong></p><p>Yeah, it’s really nice, people are going to able to look over us which is really cool.</p><p><strong>Are you worried at all about playing in a church? Is your set priest friendly or is playing ‘Black Magic’ worrying you?</strong></p><p>I mean yeah, we were going to play a church in London at one point, but the priest said we couldn’t do it because, as you say, we have ‘Black Magic’ in there which was funny. But I’m sure that some ungodly thing is going to happen tonight, we’ll have to wait and see.</p><p><strong>So, the new album <em>Future Dust</em>, is out and sounding amazing. Are you excited to get touring this November?</strong></p><p>Exactly! We’ll be back up in Scotland when we’re here for our show at Barrowlands in Glasgow. I mean that’s probably one of the shows we’re looking forward to most really. We’ve played there before and yeah, it’s just such an amazing venue. I can’t wait to be back it’s just got so much history. Glasgow is a city that loves Rock and Roll so we’re going to give it to them!</p><p><strong>Well Matt, thank you so much for joining us and I’m sure we’ll see you in Glasgow this November. In the meantime, have a great gig tonight!</strong></p><p>Nice one Finn, cheers!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iBypye_EWPo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>",

      "title": "Danny Brown - uknowwhatimsayin Album Review",
      "html": "<p>Evan Luxenbourg reviews Danny Brown's new album, <em>uknowwhatimsayin</em></p><p>A year ago, I couldn’t stand Danny Brown. Every time I heard his squeaky delivery I would immediately skip the song or turn the volume down. I had nothing against the guy, I just really disliked his voice. However, after being bombarded with recommendations to listen to his 2016 project <em>Atrocity Exhibition</em>, I sat down and forced myself to listen through it at least three times. The first time, I hated it. Sure, the beats are experimental and honestly quite brilliant, but again, Danny’s voice distracted me from enjoying his wacky lyrics and the album’s unique production. Round two went better. Maybe I trained my ears to enjoy his delivery a bit more. Once I had done one run-through, I gave myself room to focus on more details of the project. The darkness in the lyrics and production, paired with Danny’s weird delivery, actually got under my skin and stayed with me much longer than I expected. The third time around, I absolutely loved it. Everybody has an album that takes multiple listens to finally “get it,” and <em>Atrocity Exhibition (</em>and Danny Brown as a whole) was that for me.</p><p>Throughout 2019, I listened to all of Danny’s projects in reverse order of their release, and, for the most part, I loved them. Within a few months, Danny Brown went from being one of my least favourite voices in hip-hop to one of my favourites, simply because I forced myself to listen to <em>Atrocity Exhibition </em>one rainy Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>This brings us to today, where, after 3 long years of inactivity, Danny finally releases his follow-up project <em>uknowhatimsayin</em>. The singles leading up to the album hinted at a much lighter tone than <em>Atrocity</em>, which I was all for. ‘Dirty Laundry’, the first single off of the album, has Danny rapping about past sexual experiences over a wild, jazzy beat, which perfectly matches the hilarious and shocking lyrical content. By the end of the track, I was left smiling, while also feeling like I heard way too much detail about Danny’s sex-life than I needed. This is exactly what I’ve learned to love about Danny Brown: the fact that he raps about whatever he wants to, no matter how personal or inappropriate it may be.</p><p>‘Best Life’ was the second single to be released and remains to be one of my favourite tracks on the record. A string section plays a catchy, upbeat tune as Danny raps about his desire to make the most of his existence and live his “best life”. This unabashed positivity is a rare find in Danny Brown’s discography, and it’s a welcome change.</p><p>Finally, less than two weeks before his album is released, Danny drops ‘3 Tearz’ featuring prolific rap duo Run the Jewels. Honestly, I think this is the best thing Run the Jewels have done in years. Their playful banter and incredible chemistry with Brown makes this one of the most replayable rap songs of 2019, and made me wish that Run the Jewels would have as much fun in their solo projects as they do here. This song is also produced by JPEGMAFIA, a rapper/producer who released his critically acclaimed album just a few weeks prior. Though his production here is good, Peggy’s best addition to his album is his chorus on ‘Negro Spiritual’, which might be my favourite song on the album. His raspy, playful delivery is unlike anything I’ve heard from him before, and it works marvellously. It would be a crime not to mention Thundercat’s jumpy bass spearheading the Flying Lotus-produced beat. The collaboration between these four artists is something I could have only dreamt of, and it somehow lives up to expectations.</p><p>Other highlights on the record include ‘Theme Song’, with yet another happy orchestral beat, and ‘Shine’, featuring Blood Orange on a hard-hitting hook. Really, there isn’t a single bad track on the album, and the 11 tracks make for an air-tight playthrough. This is one of those rare hip-hop albums where every song works by itself while being part of a cohesive whole. It’s a really special album, and I loved it from my first listen.</p><p>Even though I love Danny Brown and I’ve been praising this album for 1.5 pages of text, it’s not perfect. For one, ‘Change Up’ is a rather low-key opening track and stands out as one of the weakest songs on the record. It has the same dark atmosphere as <em>Atrocity Exhibition</em>, but the beat and the lyrics aren’t as stand-out as anything on that album. It’s not an awful song, it’s just a disappointing way to start the record.</p><p>The title track, ‘uknowhatimsayin,’ proves to be the most forgettable song on the album. Again, it’s not a particularly bad song, but the slow-paced beat and the lyrics are a clear dip in quality compared to the songs on either end of the album. Obongjayar makes two appearances on the record and, though his hooks are impressive, his appearance on this song doesn’t elevate it beyond being just “alright.”</p><p>All of this being said, I think <em>uknowhatimsayin</em>is the best hip-hop album of 2019 thus far and shows clear evolution in Danny Brown’s sound. This is a far more enjoyable listen than 2016’s <em>Atrocity Exhibition</em> for me, and I actually prefer this new album to most of his previous work. Upon listening to <em>uknowhatimsayin </em>for what is probably the 25<sup>th</sup> time, I keep asking myself how 2018 me could have possible disliked Danny Brown, and I look forward to everything he has in store in the coming years.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ApJ1_ZliXLQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>",

      "html": "<p><strong>REVIEW BY THOMAS FUTTER </strong></p><p>The FBI is the single largest recruiter and funder of domestic terrorists in the USA.  This fact seems ridiculous. Even the film’s writer and director, Chris Morris, admitted at the Q&amp;A that accompanied the Cameo Cinema’s first UK showing of the film that his first reaction was to dismiss this statement as “insane”.  But, years later, he discovered it was true.  The FBI regularly sweet-talks groups, who would otherwise have no ways, means, and in most cases interest in committing atrocities, into planning acts of terrorism.  It then arrests them and claims the credit for stopping the acts that they planned in the first place.  After further years of intensive research, and nine years after his last film, <em>Four Lions</em>, the Day has finally come for Morris’ new work, the story of Moses (Marchánt Davis), a delusional preacher trapped inexorably in the consequences of that fact.</p><p>If this synopsis intrigues you, then I wholeheartedly recommend that you watch this film.  But don’t watch the trailer.  It gives away nearly every single plot beat, including moments just minutes before the end.  This is a shame because the escalation of the stakes is one of the film’s most rewarding aspects.  The film gets funnier and funnier as the situation veers out of every character’s control, and the final 20 minutes is the most hilarious section of all, which is rare for a comedy and so rewarding to watch unfold.  I imagine it would be even better if you don’t know details in advance.</p><p>But the other reason the trailer is so damaging is because <em>The Day Shall Come</em> is by far Chris Morris’ most understated work.  This is not to say that it is less angry than his past work.  The film is laced with contempt for the actions of these authorities, but it deliberately maintains a low key tone rather than the more visceral approach of Four Lions.  Where this works, it really works.  Marchánt Davis is phenomenally captivating and sympathetic in his first film, and the seriousness with which the film treats him and his plight allows him to shine even brighter.  Andrel McPherson is also fantastic as his accomplice.  The weakness of the approach can be seen in the treatment of the FBI, who emerge far less bruised than most of Morris’ past targets.  Rather than getting across the anger that Morris has shown in his press interviews, the FBI scenes instead play like a below par version of Veep.  All four of the credited writers worked on that series, so the similarity is unsurprising, but they fall into overfamiliar rhythms and the insults dished out feel surprisingly flat.</p><p>Despite the accomplished performances and the hilarious finale, the weaker dialogue in the FBI scenes ensure that <em>The Day Shall Come</em> falls short of the highest tier of the Chris Morris canon.  But if every other director's lesser efforts were as accomplished as this film, the world would be a richer place.</p><p><em>The Day Shall Come is in cinemas now.</em></p><p><em>Reviewed as Film of the Week, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CameoCinema/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAKPislawMGrxiIlOlKYIP0GVXzfAUHgmBMjXHmpalXq5DqZ0ekPOKWkVhdpl0anMOypoM_ffelobqg&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3m5rVwBfwOJBI9lTeXSVSV4IYSi-mkvNZrxLjX3sf9xQMBIfwQHqmnOVhTFYMde1OP-K_JXHjoyELZdbrRqQDXdlHV7H5DG6KX3FTQ1Fzhb3w-GoG7ijjb_l1NfYC7DJv3itREpuLqx53UleCbHFCPh1eylwt12_xPafkq3MvN_UySxZGvJea5I8ZySnFlrWmbaCut5-8BkE3Ga1Ro4DBM_S-mnuCuqcAOjZTcwpJqLTYt5CiI89TWL2qeKxQIcA6kU0MUg_evAWOWlP6z0X2xgsM-IjI0zCr9irfz-vyW5yJGaFEwKoHbNAOIRGXXX4EEs4yA24RniNW96daiVU\">Cameo Cinema</a>, Edinburgh.</em></p>",

      "title": "Love Song To Lavender Menace Review",
      "html": "<p><strong>REVIEW BY GEORGE ROSS </strong></p><p><em>Love Song to Lavender Menace </em>is literally that. It’s a play which is a love performance to Scotland’s first lesbian, gay and feminist bookshop ‘Lavender Menace’, who opened their doors in Edinburgh, 1982 and sadly shut them in 1997. The play centres around two employees - Glen (portrayed by Matthew McVarish) and Lewis (portrayed by Pierce Reid) - on the eve of the shop’s closure. They attempt to pay homage to founders Bob and Sigrid through various heartfelt re-enactments, whilst diverging through the 80s in hot pants, ‘dramatic’ monologues amazingly delivered by the cast and a whole lot of 80s music.</p><p>The opening of the show not only grips you with the writing (James Ley), but the expertly finessed lighting (Katharine Williams) adds another layer to the show throughout which draws the audience in, and allows them to be transported with Lewis to the streets of Edinburgh. The use of the books lit up on bookshelf adds not only to the romantic elements interwoven throughout the play, but to the element of suspense and atmosphere within the audience. The delivery of the monologues with the backdrop of this lighting, creates both a sea of tension and slight unrest, especially since both Reid and McVarish have the challenge of taking us on this journey throughout the 80s, with the addition of delivering the dark humour of daily threats and the impact of section 28.</p><p>Both Reid and McVarish bring Lewis and Glen (respectively) to life with professionalism, sincerity and the perfect level of self-indulgence throughout the play. They were able to convey what the writer  wanted to, whilst enjoying themselves on stage. There was a clear connection between both actors which gives the audience that spark of hope for something from the beginning.</p><p>The love and care brought by both actors to their performances was poignet and kept the spirit of Lavender Menace alive, with their witty one-liners, hopeful optimism displayed by Glen (McVarish) and a different approach to oppression and hatred. They faced it with joy, love and fun - something which isn’t always highlighted with portrayals of this time period.</p><p>A gay bookshop which got its start as a stall in a gay nightclub - Fire Island - (Waterstones on Princes Street today) reprised itself again as a pop-up. Bob and Sigrid are here selling queer books in the foyer of the Lyceum Theatre. It shouldn’t make me emotional but it does. How did it take 23 years since the closing of the original ‘Lavender Menace’, to bring Bob and Sigrid back together to sell books? Simple. Life got in the way. But, it was this story, <em>their story, </em>which brought them back together again. To sell books. During the play about their bookshop. Where they used to sell books. Which in itself is extremely meta, but wait until you see the play...</p><p><em>Run ended.</em></p>",

Having framed the issue, we discuss ‘What’s happening now’, setting out and unpicking the situation in the present moment. It’s a newsroom with a backroom, talking through not only what’s going on, but what we can make of it. Headline news has a history.  Espresso Adulting takes the big issues you thought you’d be mulling over at dinner parties and distils them into a must-listen one-hour audio brief. It’s a strong grounding delivered in a speedy sip. It’s all you need to know in a single shot.</p>",

      "html": "<p>“From the Gumtree I could see the world…at least, our world”.</p><p>The Price family dynamic is familiar. There are spats, arguments, and the endearing bumblings of dad, Bob. The set, the backyard and garden of 25 Windarie Avenue, is pristine and pruned to perfection- save the overbearing and overgrown Gumtree. There’s a sense of preservation to the yard throughout, that the scene is kept <em>as is</em>, desperately afraid of change. Even as the years and seasons come and go, there’s a reluctance to disturb the garden- the place of family barbeques, weddings, and togetherness. There is a particular swiftness to the lighting (Emma Hunt), at times highlighting the porch, the rose bed or the faces. There’s a well-done sense of time and place, despite the set’s, and the story’s desire to remain the same.</p><p>Bob (played by Matthew Storey) is the kind of funny uncle, brother or friend that provides a warm sense of levity when you need it most. He is exquisitely performed by Storey, whose forward gait and witty remarks break the tension over and over. Then there’s mum, Fran (played by Amelia Watson) - the story’s potentially most complex character. She’s tough and difficult to understand, perpetually angry at the world - her world – while doing anything in her power to protect it. Watson’s performance is truly stand-out here, she creates an effortless backstory of difficult decisions, resilience and strength. I am left with her performance especially when the smallest of cracks allow us to see through to a woman tired of battles and world-weary.</p><p>The four children, Pip Price (Erin Bushe), Mark/Mia Price (Matthew Sedman), Rosy Price (Maddy Chisholm-Scott), and Ben Price (Liam Bradbury) are also very well played. However, save for Sedman and Chisholm-Scott’s touching scene, there’s a lacking sense of siblingship. Not perhaps necessarily of any more importance than to say that the children’s individual stories, their relationships with their parents are the focus here. That the family home, the yard, and the garden are the focus here.</p><p>The refrain “grow-up” hit almost too close to home, (as it will for nearly all fourth-year students,) watching the characters move through heartbreak and betrayal in search of acceptance (of themselves firstly). There’s a larger refrain too, the difference between “our world”, the familiarity of it, and “the world” that necessitates a leap into the unknown. I’m left with a sense of tenderness and introspection, that my world, my comfortable university world is about to end too- and what this means for the inevitability of moving into “the world”.</p><p><em>Things I Know to be True runs at the Bedlam Theatre until 12 October 2019.</em></p>",

      "html": "<p>‘Victoria Crowe: 50 Years of Painting’ is an extensive collection of Crowe’s paintings and sketchbooks that were produced between the 1960s and today. Its focus appears to be the relationship between the viewer, artist and their myriad considerations. It doesn’t promote any way to look at this relationship and provides a lot more questions than answers. It makes the questions clear and wonders how much power we should or do have in answering them. This is both freeing and encumbering, beautiful and awful.</p><p>The exhibition is split over three floors. The first floor focuses on Crowe’s earlier paintings. In 1968, Crowe moved to a hamlet called Kittleyknowe in the Pentland Hills. Without revealing too much, they are set in and inspired by that area. What excited me, and I am smiling right now writing this, is that the Pentland Hills simultaneously appear a world unto their own, completely connected to everything and a mix of the two. This uncertainty can be applied to almost everything, and both questions and legitimizes the power of art and personal experience in thinking about things.</p><p>In 1992, Crowe visited Italy and was deeply influenced by Renaissance artwork and Italian architecture. The second floor primarily looks at Crowe’s artwork from just after her visit. In these, it becomes clear that there is an ongoing pattern of contrast in her paintings that makes it uncertain what the focus ought to be on. Crowe takes the contrast of light and dark shades to uncomfortable heights: for example, dusty, overpowering reds are contrasted with soothing beige and cool black squares. These are often combined with seemingly disparate items that are very close together. These force the viewer to try to link them and make decisions about how to look at the overall image. This makes the exhibition an intensely personal experience-unique, in a way, for each person. Personally, I felt a lot of emotions coming to the surface and realized that there are unexpected reasons why I make certain decisions about art and about everything.</p><p>The third floor contains Crowe’s more recent work. These take on a more mellow atmosphere. They mingle warm Italian skies, especially of Venice, with the cool tones of the Scottish countryside. I found myself focusing on the cool tones and the sadness of the image, disregarding the sunlight. This was interesting because I found the other artwork, in part, beautiful.</p><p>The structures of the individual floors of the exhibition are a bit confusing though this seems intentional. It is a jumbled collection of interlocking rooms, with information boards positioned in places without any rhyme or reason. In a way, this is like a motif and adds to the uncertain atmosphere. I would have liked a little more gentle guidance, but then again, I’d like that in life too. The exhibition once again becomes more personal than I’d expected.</p><p><em>‘Victoria Crowe: 50 Years of Painting’ runs at the City Art Centre until 13 October 2019. </em></p>",

      "html": "<p><strong>REVIEW BY STEPH WEAVER</strong></p><p>Gotham City, 1981. A city rife with economic disparity, and home of Arthur Fleck (played by Joaquin Phoenix), an aspiring stand-up comedian with a penchant for clown make-up. <em>Joker </em>follows Arthur’s attempts to make his way in a world that is rapidly crumbling around him, and, as a result, chaos ensues. Short version: it’s an origin story of The Joker.</p><p><em>Joker </em>was co-written by Todd Phillips and Scott Silver, and lists 1988 graphic novel <em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em> and Martin Scorsese's films as two of its inspirations. The film fared exceptionally well at its premiere at the 76<sup>th </sup>Venice International Film Festival, where it bagged the top prize of the Golden Lion, but this reviewer is here to raise the question: did it live up to the roar?</p><p>In some respects: absolutely. There is no doubt that Joaquin Phoenix is acting his multi-coloured socks off. His facial expressions, his walk, his <em>laugh</em>... All reflect his unswerving commitment to creating a compelling portrayal of Batman’s best-loved villain. The cinematography is also undeniably stunning: a saturated colour palette features throughout, creating a vibrant setting that is fresh out of a comic book.</p><p>When not revelling in the technicolour world being spun out before me, I have to say that I was thrown by its inconsistencies. This is Arthur Fleck’s origin story, and so the fact that he is the most developed character in the film is unsurprising. However, I was disappointed that the other inhabitants of his world – his mother, his therapist, his co-workers – were presented as mere stock characters, which resulted in jarring juxtapositions of the backdrop of a gritty biopic littered with dull, predictable dialogue. A subplot featuring a handful of famous faces from the Batman universe is frustratingly shoehorned in, and while the naturalistic camera work in the film was used to great effect, I found that there was an unnecessary abundance of long, lingering, artistic shots. In other words, I felt as though <em>Joker </em>played out like a beautifully crafted music video, but one that didn’t quite fit its lyrics.</p><p>In summary: aesthetically, <em>Joker </em>is magnificent, as is its leading man. I just wish more attention had been paid to crafting a plausible world for him to wreak havoc in.</p><p><em>Joker is in cinemas now.</em></p><p><em>Reviewed as Film of the Week, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CameoCinema/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAKPislawMGrxiIlOlKYIP0GVXzfAUHgmBMjXHmpalXq5DqZ0ekPOKWkVhdpl0anMOypoM_ffelobqg&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3m5rVwBfwOJBI9lTeXSVSV4IYSi-mkvNZrxLjX3sf9xQMBIfwQHqmnOVhTFYMde1OP-K_JXHjoyELZdbrRqQDXdlHV7H5DG6KX3FTQ1Fzhb3w-GoG7ijjb_l1NfYC7DJv3itREpuLqx53UleCbHFCPh1eylwt12_xPafkq3MvN_UySxZGvJea5I8ZySnFlrWmbaCut5-8BkE3Ga1Ro4DBM_S-mnuCuqcAOjZTcwpJqLTYt5CiI89TWL2qeKxQIcA6kU0MUg_evAWOWlP6z0X2xgsM-IjI0zCr9irfz-vyW5yJGaFEwKoHbNAOIRGXXX4EEs4yA24RniNW96daiVU\">Cameo Cinema</a>, Edinburgh.</em></p>",

      "title": "A Play, a Pie and a Pint: Mack the Knife Review",
      "html": "<p>Browsing the Traverse’s programme, I spotted ‘A Play, a Pie and a Pint’ – perhaps three of life’s greatest pleasures – and was immediately interested. Based in Glasgow’s West End, A Play, a Pie and a Pint produces the most new-writing of any UK theatre, staging 33 new plays annually. Founded in 2004, the concept remains the same – a new play, lasting no longer than an hour, each week, accompanied by a hearty pastry (or a vegan alternative) and a glass of the cold stuff.</p><p>Of the six PPP offerings for this season, I selected Morag Fullarton’s <em>Mack the Knife</em>. First performed in 2016, the play has returned to both Glasgow and Edinburgh as part of A Play, a Pie and a Pint’s five-hundredth-show celebrations. <em>Mack the Knife</em> follows the chaotic rehearsals of Bertolt Brecht and composer Kurt Weill’s latest play in the weeks preceding opening night. Set against the backdrop of 1920s Weimar Berlin, the unlikely success of <em>The Threepenny Opera </em>across Europe echoes the rise of Nazism in Germany until the play’s crescendo.</p><p>Fullarton’s play with songs focusses on Kurt Gerron, a real individual allegedly taunted by Nazi guards to sing his 1928 hit, ‘The Ballad of Mack the Knife’, as he walked towards the Auschwitz gas chambers. Though Keith Fleming’s narcissistic Gerron may vie for the limelight, he has a task competing with his fellow cast members. Indeed, <em>Mack the Knife</em>’s greatest strength is in the diversity of the cast’s talents, each member flitting seamlessly between characters, songs, and even musical instruments. Angela Darcy’s Lotte Lenya’s ‘Pirate Jenny’, in particular, is a suitably spooky piece.</p><p>Though frequent reference is made to the post-war context, the play’s transition from farcical fancy to fascist realism still seems abrupt. Nevertheless, <em>Mack the Knife </em>is a humorous watch about theatre-making in uncertain circumstances, and the real, bright characters who inhabited these dark times.</p><p><em>Run ended.</em></p>",

Critically, Solaris is a conscious planet, which communicates with its human visitors by sending envoys of its own – first objects, and later human-esque ‘copies’ drawn from the scientists’ own memories.</p><p>Polly Frame does well as the psychologist Kris Kelvin, conflicted between her scientific interests and emotional passions when greeted by her ‘visitor’ – former lover Ray. Jade Ogugua’s Sartorius offers the necessary contrasting voice of scepticism, peaking in her compassionate speech against the scientists continuing the ‘destroying ape’ imperialist legacy of previous human explorers. Indeed, both Kelvin and Sartorian are driven by differently-balanced combinations of scientific and emotional interests, including a desire to escape – or give reason for - their own loneliness on Earth. Ultimately, Keegan Joyce’s Ray provides the most haunting representation of loneliness, driven to crisis by confusion and isolation from his own past.</p><p>The unknowability and distance of the outer space setting mirrors the production’s central theme of loneliness. Many of the production’s most poignant lines come from Hugo Weaving’s Dr. Gibarian, who interacts with the crew via a series of pre-recorded video diaries. In Gibarian’s own tragic story, the audience sees the aforementioned conflicting scientific and emotional interests coalesce – on discovering Solaris’ consciousness, he triumphantly proclaims ‘Finally, we are not alone’.</p><p>Gibarian’s video links are but the surface of the production’s technical merits. Hyemi Shin’s sterile, white spaceship interior is visually stunning, as are the ethereal seascapes projected between the (naturally fluid) scene changes, facilitated by the set’s complex moving parts system.</p><p>David Greig’s adaptation of Stanislaw Lem’s 1961 novel is unique from earlier screen retellings of the story; the spaceship’s crew are more vocal, often engaging in heated debate in their attempts to better understand Solaris. This does more than make the plot accessible for the theatre context; it reinforces that even in frequent, lively debate with others, the sentiment of loneliness can pervade the individual psyche.</p><p>Director Matthew Lutton plays with striking images, at times reminiscent of Kubrick’s <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>. A stark comparison is drawn between the young girl and mature woman sat alone at the start and end of the play – perhaps both hopeful to make contact. In asking who are we as individuals then, <em>Solaris</em> concludes that our ultimate commonality is our experience of loneliness.</p><p><em>Solaris </em>runs at the Royal Lyceum until 5 October, then at Lyric Hammersmith, London, between 10 October and 2 November.<br></p>",

Renowned for its international theatrical presence, Summerhall’s Festivals programme tends towards bigger budget and scaled productions. This year, I was fortunate enough to catch a great many more than the word limit of this collated review permits. Here, I’ve focussed on five social and political-themed pieces from across Summerhall’s varied programme.</p><p>Cardboard Citizens’ <i>Bystanders </i>interrogates the rise of homelessness as the product of government austerity and society’s rising tendency to dehumanise rough sleepers. The four-strong cast leap between six almost-verbatim stories of homelessness, including that of an individual who doused a homeless man begging outside of a supermarket with paint, and uploaded the recorded footage online as a warning to others. The six broken and interspersed narratives demonstrate the worrying degree of neglect and contempt with which we, as a society, treat homeless individuals and the issue at large. Furthermore, by often illuminating these stories from the perspective of the homeless people themselves, the production counters the dominant media broad-brush narrative of the problem. Cardboard Citizens make theatre with and for homeless people, and the stress on the nearly-verbatim nature of the play is intentional and resonant – it simply couldn’t be actual verbatim, because many of the victims of homelessness are now dead. Strong in both message and performance, <i>Bystanders </i>does exactly as it suggests, demanding its audience to reject its very title and take conscious action.</p><p>By contrast, Matt Woodhead’s <i>Who Cares </i>is almost entirely verbatim. The play is the product of two years of interviews with young carers in Salford and others involved in the social care system, including social workers, policy makers, and the cared-for. Often, it is difficult to reconcile verbatim pieces with the narrative flow and flexibility permitted by more fictional or interpretative pieces. Though it<i> </i>doesn’t escape these problems entirely, <i>Who Cares </i>does give voice to three young carers, telling their stories from their school uniforms. Through these detailed and often sad histories, the play actually extends beyond the individual to reinforce that the UK social care system is propped up by unpaid and unaccounted-for young carers. Much like <i>Bystanders, </i>then, <i>Who Cares </i>is an expression of individual stories intended to illuminate the social and political problem at large.</p><p>Moving to Summerhall’s Roundabout venue, Middle Child Theatre’s <i>The Canary and the Crow </i>describes the life of a working-class black child at a privileged (read: posh) white grammar school. Through vibrant and punchy gig theatre, writer and performer Daniel Ward tells his story about growing up black in white-dominated environments, a story especially pertinent given the Fringe’s continual problems of racist and classist discrimination. The blend of classical and grime music might seem unlikely, but it was well-executed by fellow perfomers Nigel Taylor, Laurie Jamieson, and Rachel Barnes, much to the entertainment of the packed crowd in the round. Avoiding criticisms of generalisation, the play is self-admittedly an expression of one (rather than <i>the</i>) black experience. Yet the performance and message are unapologetically bold, engaging the audience from the humorously overexaggerated accents of Ward’s posh classmates, to the storyline’s dramatic crescendo.</p><p>Caroline Horton’s <i>All of Me</i> – winner of the Mental Health Fringe Award 2019 - offers a refreshingly holistic view of mental health. Central to the piece is the message that depression and other mental illnesses often – in the words of <i>The Guardian</i>’s Catherine Love - ‘ebb and flow’, counter to the dominant linear narrative into recovery. Asking her depression if and when it will return, it responds that ‘it will again, and then it won’t again’, over and over to the play’s outing. During the production process, Horton became ill again, informing the play’s overarching dark tones. Indeed, <i>All of Me </i>is likely the most challenging piece of theatre I watched over August; some audience members during my performance left, following bizarre, hard-to-interpret scenes. On reflection, the seemingly obscure nature of the production is perhaps intentional to Horton’s message - that there is neither reason nor rationality in mental illness, and thus we should not expect it in (theatrical or otherwise) expressions of mental health issues. Instead, she boldly suggests to ‘unfuck the world’ in order to reduce the number of shows about mental illness.</p><p>At just forty minutes run time, Ahmed El Attar’s <i>Before the Revolution </i>undercuts the Fringe standard. Actors Ramsi Legner and Nanda Mohammad, both dressed entirely in white and standing stationary on a bed of nails for the entirety of the performance, deliver a set of vignettes of life in Egypt over the last twenty years, entirely in Egyptian Arabic. Through these snapshots of Egypt’s cultural traditions and society, the piece aims to illuminate a better understanding of the causes of, and events in, the Egyptian Revolution in 2011. The subtitles sometimes lagged behind the fast-paced delivery, preventing the audience from fully appreciating the facial gestures and acting of both performers - which are to be especially commended given their static poses. Nevertheless, these snippets of family and social life, including jokes about a presidential visit to a primary school, provide individual outlooks into the social climate precipitating revolution.</p><p>Once more, Summerhall’s programme certainly offered plenty with respect to my tastes for socially and politically-charged theatre. Some unmentioned favourites from this year’s programme include <i>Buzz</i> and <i>Taiwan Season: FISH </i> - you can catch up on recorded interviews with the cast and production teams from these shows, amongst others, at <a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/Fresh_Air/\">https://www.mixcloud.com/Fresh_Air/</a>.</p>",

Her perfectly pink and sterile bubble not only bursts, but explodes, as Alannah’s renegade sister Fianna – brought to life by Lisa Dwyer Hogg – crashes in through the window, leaving a trail of muddy footprints behind her. These are but the first steps into chaos, which ensues in the sisters’ efforts to redress the patriarchal suppression of their abusive father.</p><p><i>Crocodile Fever</i> is the latest dark comedy from Northern Irish playwright Meghan Tyler, a winner of the Channel 4 Playwright’s Scheme in 2019. Though the play is set in a rural Catholic household during the Troubles, the social context is not the focus, rather the necessary pretext for a raucous and unbelievable set of events. The reality of raiding paramilitaries becomes normalised in contrast to the magical-realist storyline and bloody violence in the home.</p><p>McEvoy and Dwyer Hogg’s respective Alannah and Fianna are polar opposites – the former embodied in her ‘hairstyle of efficiency’ and meticulously-prepared gin and tonic, the latter in her unkept Gene Simmonds-esque barnet and slurped wine glass of rum. Despite their apparent and underlying differences, the two find unity in their mutual hatred of the smell of their reptilian father’s pipe. Their believable personal relationship both drives and grounds the surreal storyline.</p><p>Leaving the same household seventy minutes later – in a considerably more disorderly state – I chuckled listening to a Gaelic version of ‘Africa’, a subtle reference to Alannah’s earlier misunderstanding of the titular line as ‘I guess it rains on an apricot’. In these details, Gareth Nicholls’ production and Grace Smart’s set and staging strengthen Tyler’s well-crafted links between the individual story and the wider social context.</p><p><i>Crocodile Fever </i>runs at the Traverse Theatre until 25 August.</p>",

It’s a fitting setting for <i>Collapsible</i>, Margaret Perry’s play about a woman ungrounded by her recent break-up and unemployment.</p><p>Unsatisfied by internet quizzes which label her (amongst other things) as a ‘lamb’ person, Essie attempts to re-establish her own identity by collating a list of adjectives from her friends and family to describe herself. The disconnect between these meaningless phrases – particularly ‘feet on the ground’ – and her current reality supports her critique of vague job interview descriptors, and more widely our tendency to define ourselves by others’ perceptions of us.</p><p>Under Thomas Martin’s direction, Holahan’s Essie is deeply introspective, perpetuating her own state of isolation. For instance, she worries whether all of her benevolent actions for others are selfishly motivated, if she has undertaken acts of kindness in an effort to be perceived by others as kind. These harsh and glaring insights, which extend to criticisms of internet culture, continue as Essie spirals to question whether she is even real at all.</p><p>One particular strength in Holahan’s performance is in her ability to relate to the audience. An (other-defined) ‘militant perfectionist’, Holahan contorts into an uncomfortable, creature-like squat with eyes pinned open, proclaiming she’d rather ‘do nothing at all than something almost great’. From midway along the rigged seating, I was eye-to-eye with Holahan, her manic state resounding with my own tendencies in striving towards some so-called ‘objective perfection’.</p><p>Holahan’s solo performance is enhanced not only by Alison Neighbour’s striking set, but Alex Fernandes’ subtle lighting, which shrouds Holahan is glimmering golds in moments of romantic nostalgia, and intense reds in her darkest moments of introspection. Well-crafted and well-executed, <i>Collapsible</i>’s own storyline of reflection urges audiences to do the same.</p><p><i>Collapsible </i>runs at Assembly Roxy until 25 August, and at HighTide Festival in Aldeburgh between 10-15 September.</p>",

I was pleasantly surprised, however, to experience a play about comedy and love. Oblivious nice guy Steve (Daniel Cech-Lucas) enlists cynical comedian Alice (Elly Condron) to teach him to be funny in order to win back his suddenly distant girlfriend. Chaos ensues.</p><p>The show used the small space, appropriately named Bunker One, extremely well. Despite (or because of?) the scarce audience on the night that I went, the actors interacted with us in clever ways and made us feel like we were part of the story. The vibe was warm and friendly. The show shifted between stand-up and theatrical scenes with ease, and the minimal set, props, and lighting enhanced things without being distracting.</p><p>The acting was great, but it wasn’t quite enough to make up for characters and plot which sometimes seemed one-dimensional. Without giving things away, the course of the story was somewhat predictable, and Alice and Steve were little more than their stereotypical tropes – comedian who can’t form relationships, hopelessly boring businessman. That said, <i>Don’t Be Terrible</i> was funny, heartfelt, and dark in turns. It was different than anything else I saw this Fringe, it interrogated comedy in interesting ways, and it was thoroughly entertaining.</p><p>Don’t Be Terrible runs at Pleasance Bunker One at 23:00 until 26<sup>th</sup> August.</p>",

The hour-long show tackles everything from colonialism to foreskin, all with Robinson’s characteristically chill and relatable humor. The show was so hilarious that I saw it twice – once to review and another time with my visiting friend – and even the second time around, the hour was just as raunchy and hysterical.</p><p>Phoebe wasn’t afraid to tackle issues of gender and race, and she did so in a way which was both casual and grounded in personal experience (like leaving a march early to grab brunch), while still aware of broader systems and structures. The hour-long set featured countless references to how the events of her own life might fall in comparison to Black History more broadly and those PoC who came before her, as the title of the show might suggest.</p><p>Her conversational tone made the audience feel like they were chatting with a friend; she took breaks to tie her shoe, sip from a mug, and ask where we were from, but the silences never felt uncomfortable. Even FaceTiming her boyfriend mid-show didn’t seem particularly out of place, although it was definitely an odd digression. A bit unpacking the ending scene of Kingsman – she had just seen the movie on cable and needed to talk about it – was a personal favorite. Despite taking place in a converted lecture theatre, the show felt friendly and warm, and the audience was completely comfortable interacting with both Phoebe and each other.</p><p><i>Sorry, Harriet Tubman</i> was a great reminder that although comedy can be big and flashy and full of props, sometimes the best shows don’t need any of that. Phoebe Robinson’s personality and humor were more than enough.</p><p><em>Phoebe Robinson: Sorry, Harriet Tubman</em> runs at Assembly George Square Three at 18:45 until 25th August.</p>",

The range of female characters was refreshing and the hour went by quickly, thanks to Spence’s ability to engage with her character acting.</p><p>The acting was done so well that it was difficult to laugh at the therapist Janet Waitrose, as over the course of the hour the audience almost became too attached to the heroine. The other characters played by Spence were definitely impressive, but the sheer number of them made it difficult to get attached to any.</p><p>Spence also used a clever screen trick where she would walk behind the screen and change character both in person and on the screen, like a magician’s quick change. The tech, however was either impressively smooth and almost unbelievable or slightly awkward when slightly off.  Spence had good interactions with the audience, who were definitely on her side at the start, however with some unnecessary parts - there wasn’t much of a comedic gain from the life drawing.</p><p>Overall, the hour was a very interesting concept, however Spence seemed to spread herself a little too thin; in delving further into one character and focusing on her great acting skills the show could have been improved.

She aims to question and destroy the stereotypes of Muslim women portrayed in the media and political sector by simply letting Muslim women from a varied background of race, income, and age speak for themselves.</p><p>Even having read the book, hearing the authors do a reading was something special. It’s one thing to read someone else’s story in your head, but having the author read to you in their own voice is worth going to see a book event for. Much like how music in a film can the determining push between being overwhelmed with emotion or not. Each woman brought her own glowing and glittering personality, be it Saleem’s clever and bubbly Glasgow accent showing moments of vulnerability, Jassat’s fairy-godmother-like storytelling abilities, or Khan’s intelligent approach on the necessity of a new wave of intersectional – not just white, cis, atheist, and able-bodied – feminism.</p><p>Additionally, it was super interesting to know that none of the authors had met each other until the publishing. Khan used this as a technique to keep the authors true to themselves and to be completely raw with what they wanted to discuss. As the editor herself, Khan felt she was able to avoid a toning down of the stories, keeping their authenticity.</p><p>Unfortunately, during the Q&amp;A section, a member of the audience exemplified just why this book is so necessary today. A woman shared a story of Muslims she knew being forced into marriage and how it upset her; this felt like more of a “defend your religion” moment than a genuine question. A dangerous stereotype of forced marriage in the Muslim community was projected onto our panel which they were then asked to defend. Although Khan handled the incident incredibly well, with the composure of a woman who has heard this so many times that she knows exactly what to say, this made the moment no less jarring for me. Even at an event where it would be assumed that the audience was open-minded and attempting to actively unlearn stereotypes, these insidious comments still sneak in. This question at least allowed the whole audience to be privy to a moment usually reserved for Muslim women to deal with again and again, and Saleem made it clear that this was not the first time she was asked to discuss such heavy topics such as forced marriages.</p><p>The event finished with a man identifying as physically disabled addressing how much he adored the women’s courage in writing the book and emphasizing how people who deviate from society’s “norm” can’t just be as good, but better. So, if you haven’t already, go devour <i>It’s Not About The Burqa</i>: teach yourself about Muslim feminist role models, the stories of normal Muslim women, Muslim engineers, those who identify as bisexual, and simply open your heart.</p><p>The Edinburgh International Book Festival runs until 26th August.</p>",

The lack of male role models in her life, too, is entertainingly balanced with jokes about children’s shows – each trauma is made funny and relatable to the audience with her skill. Duker even pulls out the twisted way in which we might be attracted to cartoon characters, a topic I’ve never seen broached before but definitely exists. She continually keeps the audience on their toes and checking themselves while laughing away.</p><p>Duker’s descriptions are one of a kind – a personal favourite being “plain old ready salted daddy” – turning the most general observational comedy into a super original point-of view from the too-little heard perspective of women of colour.</p><p>If you fancy coming out of a show laughing and also questioning your privilege, who your role models are, and whether to update your Tinder then get yourself down the Pleasance Below.</p><p><em>Sophie Duker: Venus</em> runs at Pleasance Below at 19:00 until 25th August.</p>",

The whole idea seems dangerous, too: every script is totally unrehearsed. Even the tech person barely knows what’s going on, a fact that our hosts joke about at the show’s very start.</p><p>But the Irish comedy podcasters are good. So damn good, in fact, that it doesn’t matter that I’ve never actually seen <i>Jurassic Park</i>, the film they’re taking aim at on the rainy Friday night I choose to go, all the way through. How they manage to condense an entire film into an hour full of constant, bellyache-worthy gags is anyone’s guess, but <i>Film Reads </i>is a work of art. The writers and cast know Spielberg’s source material so well — and obviously have a soft spot for it — that they can show it for how ridiculous it often is, and do so brilliantly. The cast are unafraid to go meta or tackle meaty issues like sexism, and they even poke fun at themselves; a quick joke about one of the cast’s hilariously dodgy, unplaceable accent gets one of the biggest laughs of the night.</p><p>It’s obvious that the performers are enjoying it just as much as the raucous audience, and it’s wonderful to see. Each cast member is hugely talented and they play even the tiniest supporting roles with aplomb – it’s practically impossible to pick a standout moment, although my Goldblum-obsessive heart is stolen by Tony Cantwell’s shockingly good embodiment of the honey-voiced chaos theorist. I’m a full-blown convert at this point: I’d absolutely love to see how they interpret the other films on their roster, from <i>The Lord of the Rings </i>to what I can only expect to be an unforgettable version of <i>Silence of the Lambs. </i>Something very deep inside me <i>needs</i> to experience a Dreamgun Hannibal Lecter.</p><p>For film buffs, casual viewers and, well, basically anyone, it would be a crime to miss <i>Film Reads. </i>An hour absolutely stuffed full of laughs, raptors and sheer joy, this show truly is dreamy.</p><p><i>Dreamgun: Film Reads</i> runs at Underbelly Dairy Room at 22:15 until 25th August.</p>",

In <i>Camp Binch</i>, Parker uses his platform to its full potential, quite literally. Not only is his intensely personal subject matter important, but the man can <i>move</i>. At times, his faux leather-trousered form practically leaps across the stage; he’s glittering with sweat beneath the stage lights, which becomes a running gag after he warns the front row about sitting in his very own “splash zone”.  This dynamism never lets up as Parker, with the aid of some deliciously-90s childhood photos, takes those gathered on a comic voyage through his life.</p><p>From his time as New Zealand’s premier child actor to his excruciating high school years as a gay youth in a rural, rugby-mad school, Parker’s stories mix the hilarious with the sometimes heart-wrenching; this is a show about identity, community and acceptance, replete with musical numbers and celebrations of the gay agenda. There’s some interesting character comedy and wig-work dotted throughout, but this falls flatter than much of the rest of Parker’s material. If these sections were tightened up and the characterisation deepened a little, <i>Camp Binch </i>could feel like a much smoother, slightly less frenetic show.</p><p>Saying this, most of the audience were fully involved and very entertained, especially a vocal American couple that Parker adopted as his new parents (“sorry, mum and dad!”, he jokes to his own parents, who are actually watching this performance). Even if I wasn’t so much a fan of the character interludes, the ending of <i>Camp Binch</i>—a message about creating and nurturing spaces where everyone can be seen and supported, no matter their interests, sexualities or wider identities—still hits hard and remains very necessary. At times it seems slightly unpolished, but <i>Camp Binch </i>is still properly good fun and Parker’s verve is often captivating to witness.</p><p><em>Chris Parker: Camp Binch</em> runs at Assembly Studio 5 at 18:50 until 25th August.</p>",

Joe is casually dancing on stage to the pre-show playlist and not shying away from eye contact.</p><p>Although an opener about how much he hates theatre and modern dance seemed somewhat misplaced for a Fringe audience, both the set and the audience warmed up over the fast-paced hour. The Spice Girls reunion tour structured the show, yet allowed for countless digressions, from anxiety to the desire to be a better person to growing up gay in Coventry. The show flowed effortlessly from topic to topic, and Joe particularly shined in the smaller one-liners and random bits thrown in between, like a Glaswegian doing ASMR or ways to pretend to be posh.</p><p>Joe courts a catty, sarcastic, self-involved persona, yet despite his best efforts, as the show goes on a genuinely lovely and self-reflective guy shines through the cracks. Ruminations on politics and pride are apt without being pretentious. A bit about the Spice Girls as alt-right metaphor is hysterical. The show takes you through a variety of serious topics, but you hardly even realize until the very end because you’ve been laughing through it all.</p><p>Fundamentally, Sour is focused on the past: how can we reckon with it, look back nostalgically (or not) at it, and move on from it? How can a flamboyant anti-war schoolyard protestor become a UKIP supporter – and what version of the past informs such a shift? These questions are essential, and I’m not just saying that because I’m a history student.</p><p>Go see <em>Sour</em> – it’s funny, it’s timely, and it’s free (although you really should pay at the end – and they’ve got a card machine). Plus, it’s just down the road from Hive.</p><p><em>Joe Sutherland: Sour</em> runs at Banshee Labyrinth at 22:10 until 25th August.</p>",

The audience from this point are fully allowed to laugh at these ridiculous men in spandex. Additionally, the physical act of sharing drinks round and passing them from audience member to audience member create a warm and friendly atmosphere in the room – it was easy to start a conversation with your neighbour. The audience was completely at ease which is no small feat at a Fringe show.</p><p>The pair embodied your loveable drunk uncles at a family party; of course good fun and entertaining, but also explaining the history of their drinks. Although one actor seemed to be getting influenced by the booze he was drinking, stuttering at times and forgetting lines, the pair had brilliant stage presence. The pair were physically hilarious (one particularly entertaining segment involved dressing up as Can-Can dancers), however they fell slightly short on the non-physical jokes, falling back on puns and cheesy one-liners which didn’t land particularly well with the audience. The toast to Ching Shih was simply inappropriate, too.</p><p>Scientists and drinkers alike will enjoy the show. By combining both free (!) drinks including beer, whiskey, rum, gin and Grand Mariner (!!) with interesting tid-bits and fun facts both the taste buds and brain were satisfied. A worry that the drink might be gimmicky was lost when the top-shelf alcohol was brought out.</p><p>Although tasty and a sight to behold, the information was a little lost through the haze of booze – I would have loved if on the flyer, in addition to information about the drinks, the scientist discussed was also noted. Even if the precursor to the section with female scientists was cliché and unnecessary, the facts were always interesting. The performers had a good balance of being educational without being snobby (far from the usual whiskey-drinking mansplainer).</p><p>If you fancy a fun pre-drink at 8:20, this show is perfect for getting you tipsy for the night. I left in a brilliant mood (however more likely due to the booze-buzz than the jokes) and full of the knowledge: <i>drink less and better</i>!</p><p><em>The Thinking Drinkers: Heroes of Hooch</em> runs at Underbelly Cowbarn at 20:20 until 25th August.</p>",

Tucked away just behind Bristo Square, Underbelly Buttercup may be slightly more intimate of a setting than many of the Fringe’s other venues, but Blotnick’s boisterous and very personal set goes big, taking the small but lively audience on an unfailingly funny ride through her life.</p><p>From her obsession with Amazon reviews (perhaps the ultimate cure for loneliness) to buying dodgy vitamins off the internet that probably do nothing and more, <i>Party Nights</i> unravels Blotnick’s attempts to deal with her neuroses and work on her mental health— and it’s great. Even at its maddest, the set’s always distinctly relatable: we’ve all sent late-night angry emails to corporations when we’ve had nothing else to do, although maybe not on the level of Blotnick’s incredible email to Dyson. We’ve all shared Blotnick’s desire to become absolutely “nothing,” too. Existential dread: a universal, and universally funny, experience that <i>Party Nights</i> addresses with a delightful slither of self-deprecation.</p><p>Blotnick’s personal material is fantastic, but she shines brightest when using it to delve into the mess that is pop culture. Her musings on confidence slide into an impression of Salma Hayek that brought wonderful tears to my eyes, and her recounting of a Beyoncé-themed dance class she once attended has the audience cackling. Some of my favourite moments come in the form of Blotnick’s reflections upon the absolute unit of a man that is Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. I will never think of cod in the same way again.</p><p>It’s a real shame the audience wasn’t fuller – Blotnick is one of those people who is just naturally, hilariously funny. Though the show loses its momentum at points and a few moments fall a little flat, Blotnick manages to pull it back and deliver a small delight of a set that flies by. <i>Party Nights</i> deserves to be seen by more. Go find that shipping container; you won’t regret it.</p><p>Emmy Blotnick: Party Nights runs at Underbelly Buttercup at 7:55pm until 26th August.</p>",

Centred around ideas of memory and trauma—the trauma of a fateful but blurry trip to sexy, sexy Swansea, to be exact—<i>The Bumswing </i>is intensely personal comedy that manages to stay (mostly) light-hearted, despite the recorded intro’s declaration of “I hope you like comedy about emotional abuse!” Exploring her own, admittedly shocking memory, Hagen covers ground from why the Windsors have nothing on the aforementioned, bad-ass Danish monarch to an unforgettable — for most — incident involving twelve-year-olds and fowl.</p><p>The set can sometimes meander along the way, although Hagen’s interactions with a Swede in the audience and impressions of her Danish mother are enjoyable digressions. But Hagen tightens up in the show’s second half to deliver a final, powerful gut-punch that pulls her comic threads together perfectly. It takes balls to do what Hagen does within the last ten minutes of her show. Though the near-full audience takes a while to warm up, they are, by this point, stunned.</p><p>As am I: disarmed by Hagen’s promise of a blithe show and by the slightly baggier first half, the set’s ending is pretty astounding, and really, really funny. Hagen mixes trauma, hilarious anecdote and tale-telling skill in brilliantly funny ways and ends on a high. It’s something you really have to see for yourself – if you want light-hearted but hard-hitting comedy this Fringe, take a seat on <i>The Bumswing</i>.</p><p><em>Sofie Hagen: The Bumswing</em> runs at Pleasance Queen Dome until 25th August.</p>",

She has been in shows on BBC, Netflix and even won the BAFTA Rotcliffe New Writing award last year for her script <i>Baby. </i>However, she never quite made it as the West End star she dreamed of becoming, telling the audience there is hope yet since she has written no less than forty-five musicals. The story of her desire to fulfil this dream is brightly conveyed through a series of songs and stand-up with the hilarious subtext of a delusional washed-up actor.</p><p>She invites her audience to “check out her range” in the opening track, and her training in musical theatre, although being parodied, is shrewdly employed. The material for the show focuses on her experiences the music theatre world, a highlight being a song personifying a white posh girl trying to be cast in Hamilton. Her brief moment of stardom in the small-time 00s girl band ‘Cherry Falls’ is hilariously reflected on and segues into more pop-parody-esque numbers. She creates the impression that she hasn’t quite moved on and ruthlessly satirises this sickly-sweet era of pop. Bede is strongest on material about the expectations of women in the music and musical theatre industry, as well as wider feminist topics including a song about mansplaining. In a time where we are increasingly aware of the treatment of young women in these industries, her character feels believably damaged by her being cast from the limelight as quickly as she stepped into it.</p><p>Nonetheless, it’s clear that Bede is having fun and her playful parodies offer punters more for their money than conventional musicals at the festival.</p><p><em>Jenny Bede: The Musical</em> runs at Just the Tonic at The Mash House: Just the Cask Room until 25th August.</p>",

Titania McGrath has risen to the fore of Twitter satire in an age where the \"radical intersectionalist poet committed to feminism, social justice and armed peaceful protest\" isn’t a far cry from authentic virtue-signalling that happens online. The comedian Andrew Doyle’s creation went above and beyond the Twittersphere earlier this year with her book ‘Woke: A Guide to Social Justice,’ which was well-received by critics. The challenge for Alice Marshall, cast to play Titania, was to satisfy those who already had an image of her in their minds.</p><p>The tone for the performance is set by a short clip of the new Prime Minister followed by crashing thunder; McGrath wins Fringe Bingo within the first minute. Other clips of milkshakes, Farage and Robinson introduce what has ‘triggered’ Titania. After this, she tells the audience that they have come to a lecture, not a comedy show, since the latter is a construct of the patriarchy. Marshall offers a posh, tightly-strung, borderline-sociopath and establishes this with a couple of brilliant ad-libs to both latecomers and her own tech-assistant; no-one is going to get in the way of her ‘lecture’.</p><p>The big idea for her Mxnifesto is a new political party called ‘Shame UK’ whose policies include compulsory veganism and decolonising the BAFTAs. The latter proposal is a genius take on the enormous scrutiny awards ceremonies have become subject to in recent years, chiefly on social media. As the show progresses, however, the freshness of the material begins to buckle slightly under the weight of a character who isn’t entirely conceivable. Characterfully performed raps and a sketch about killing baby Hitler just about prop up a second half which concludes with tribal-costumed song and dance. These cheaper laughs don’t feel entirely consistent with a character who is meant to take herself seriously as a social-justice warrior but will no doubt entertain punters without any preconceptions from her Twitter.</p><p>Titania McGrath: Mxnifesto runs at Pleasance Above until 25th August.</p>",

You’ve been flyered within an inch of your life on your way to the show. It’s already ridiculously warm in the sauna-like Pleasance Beneath. But as soon as New York’s rising cabaret-comedy star Catherine Cohen steps in front of her golden, tinselled backdrop and unleashes an hour-full of vocal stylings that oscillate between a manic retired Boadway actress and sleepy NYC influencer, none of that really matters. From Cohen’s nigh-on nonsensical delivery to some hysterically physical moments—her constant foot-pops and a full-body re-enactment of taking a reference photo for her gynaecologist are especially great—everything about <i>The Twist…</i> is gloriously funny.</p><p>Cohen, host of a weekly show at Alan Cummings’ legendary cabaret bar Club Cumming and her podcast <i>Seek Treatment</i>, is an Edinburgh first-timer, though you wouldn’t know it. Thanks to rave reviews, Cohen is this year’s debut darling; her shows have been packed and uproarious, with even <i>Game of Thrones</i>’s Emilia Clarke spotted in the crowd just a week ago. This show is no different. The audience, aside from one exhausted punter who dozes off half-way through and is promptly, hilariously awakened by Cohen, is buzzing and lively throughout. From musings on life, sex and self-image to dramatic recitals of Instagram poetry and so much more, the set delivers on the hype: her satire is guffaw-worthy, slightly bizarre and distinctly relatable. Cohen’s unravelling of the interior lives of young, modern women is so blade-sharp because alongside people who view fruit as dessert and psychopathic joggers, she is her own target. Not only is she unafraid to follow diversions from her core material and provocatively interact with her crowd throughout, but Cohen fearlessly takes aim at everything about herself, both in her spoken interludes and mid-song.</p><p>Those songs, focal points of the set co-written with her brilliant musical collaborator Henry Koperski, are gold. Musical comedy that doesn’t make every atom of my being want to implode on itself is honestly a miracle, but Cohen’s voice and lyrical wit are fresh and genuinely entertaining. Opening with what she coins as her origin story—\"boys never wanted to kiss me, so now I do comedy”—her songs range from a desperate plea for Urban Outfitters to make clothes that actually fit real human women to a ditty about murder that balances on the edge of being absolutely bonkers. An obvious reference point for many could be Rachel Bloom’s <i>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, </i>but the saccharine yet darkly acidic edge to Cohen’s comedy sets her in a musical space of her own.</p><p><i>The Twist…? She’s Gorgeous </i>is, bluntly, great. If you want a break from the same old stand-up, go. Even if you don’t, still go. To echo Cohen herself, <i>the Twist… </i>is brave. I’m obsessed. <i>J’adore</i>.</p><p><i>Catherine Cohen: The Twist… ? She’s Gorgeous</i> runs at 22:45 at Pleasance Beneath until 25th August.</p>",

Jack Gleadow takes the audience back in time to when the main entertainment on a Saturday night was variety. Showing them exactly why he has a multitude of awards to his name.</p><p>What’s necessary for a variety host? A big personality, that’s for sure, and Gleadow is almost like a cartoon. His cheeky grin and Hull accent, along with his surreal grandpa-esque outfit make him unforgettable. Gleadow as a performer has you laughing at every angle. Laughing in sympathy at his sob stories. Laughing at his physical comedy and random props. Laughing at his sweet childhood efforts at “magic”. Although it’s not always the done thing to laugh at dad jokes, the audience was helpless to Gleadow’s cheesy lines and puns. Sometimes skits felt too drawn out; however, any awkwardness seemed to add to the lovability of his character. Think the generation game: sibling to the audience, full of dad jokes while decked out in your grandpa’s finest.</p><p>Beyond his storytelling abilities, Gleadow transforms the venue into an entertainment show by including music and surprise props, toeing the line between stand up and sketch show. The clever use of music turns funny stories into full-bodied physical skits, which now come to mind whenever the songs play or Tinder is open. By using previous recordings, the audience could witness his worst nightmares both on screen and in real life - resulting in an original twist on a usually cliché trope.</p><p>With so much comedy requiring a serious understanding of topical issues, some absolute silliness was super refreshing. Simple, bring-your-mum-along and right on the funny bone comedy.</p><p>Jack Gleadow: Mr. Saturday Night runs at Pleasance Below at 17:45 until 25th August.</p>",

In her musical comedy show <i>Kate Lucas: Is Selling Herself, </i>the basement bar is turned into a cosy afterparty with just a guitar and pure wit. From bad one-night stands to worse bank account balances, the frustrations of Kate Lucas are captured perfectly in song.</p><p><b>Going Once?</b></p><p>After the ubiquity of comedy at the fringe, musical comedies are just the tonic, where guitar arpeggios and chords fill the silences between stories and punchlines and silences. Kate Lucas’s humour is certainly self-deprecating, but it’s more embarrassingly relatable than embarrassingly awkward. The guilt of laughing at someone’s low self-worth dissipates when you realise it’s not just the performer who is being laughed at, but the whole room who hear themselves in the lyrics.</p><p><b>Going Twice?</b></p><p>Our songbird has more up her sleeve, with clear messages about exactly why our self-worth is so low, a particularly shocking statistic about Tinder, and the sheer magnitude of advertising today. You might even come away feeling slightly better about that shame-filled decision you made the other night stemming from low self-worth – Kate’s done it too. Feeling slightly better that your bank balance isn’t higher. Feeling slightly better that you aren’t an Instagram influencer.  Feeling slightly better that you aren’t the perfect product.</p><p><b>Sold.</b></p><p>I can’t wait until these songs are targeted ads towards me on Spotify.</p><p>Kate Lucas: Is Selling Herself runs at Just The Tonic - The Tron at 18:20 until 25th August.</p>",

With this particular night involving a child-catcher-like tooth fairy, suicidal laserquest and saucy Harry Potter fan fiction, no one has the slightest clue what the show will consist of. Head through the church bustling with students to the venue for some first-class improv.</p><p><b>Introverts?</b></p><p>Not in the slightest. The performers were captivating with their storytelling abilities; they had me in awe of how easily it was to picture the imaginary scene and characters. For an hour, you were being transported from a land with giant frogs to being inside a mouth with seemingly no effort at all. One performer’s physical comedy in particular had me howling even at an imaginary tongue (it’s insane, I know, just go with it). This apparent ease made the performance feel like you were just watching your friends mess around – no cringing and no feeling tense for possible mishaps.</p><p>Admittedly, at times performers couldn’t quite think up a joke or plotline immediately, which seems to be par for the course with improv, and in fact only emphasised how clean-cut and smooth the rest of the show was. The nature of the audience and show made light of any unfinished storylines, and the sketches were so quick that all was forgotten, while laughing heartily at the next sketch.</p><p><b>Brilliant Bedlam</b></p><p>Whether the perfect end to the night at half one in the morning or just the start to your unique comedy treasure trail, the show that you see will be completely different and hopefully just as side-splitting. I can’t wait to go back and see what more they have tucked up their sleeve. A two headed alien? Colin Firth’s dad? A giant frog? I’m buzzing.</p><p>Improverts runs at Bedlam Theatre at 00:30 until 25th August.</p>",

Whatever British awkwardness about the big, bold personality on stage was immediately dissipated by her self-deprecating humour about being American. The crowd was already on her side and was almost continuously laughing for the whole hour.</p><p>Through the rose-tinted glasses of a twenty-something, it can be difficult to imagine not loving your friends; Barron was here to make the realities of love-hate relationships very clear. It was a good insight into the cynical outlook of your thirties, with resounding relatability from an older audience. When younger members of the crowd sometimes failed to laugh, Barron, with expert crowd work, made the show funny for all ages. A couple of moments fell flat, though: a segment on race felt a little out-of-touch with today’s terminology, and a misinterpretation of the lack of enthusiasm to being British as self-hate was really just because we were in Scotland.</p><p>The speed at which we, as individuals, jump to judgements was brutally and correctly observed by Barron, making the show completely relatable. The absolute joy of revelling in others misfortune. Barron gave a pathway out for the hidden depths of taboo emotions – revenge, Schadenfreude, hate – within the audience to surface for the duration of the show. While the audience were laughing to hide their guilt, Barron feasts on it. She allows the feelings of hate nagging beneath the surface to be explored, allowing you to revel in the emotions that would usually be suppressed.</p><p>The show was unique in that Barron is not simply voicing the female point of view as a difficult struggle through the mud, but as a cathartic outlet for the more taboo emotions to be felt. I am coming away wondering whether I really am as good a hero as I considered myself…</p><p>Sara Barron: Enemies Closer runs at Pleasance Courtyard (Upstairs) at 20:30 until 25th August.</p>",

Leaving the blistering, hour-long show,<i> </i>I found myself feeling three things: anger, energy, and a strange sense of relief. I’m angry because the injustices that she draws her material from are so real, not only for me but for so many in the room. I’m energised by her quick, no-holds-barred delivery that lands each of her attacks right on target. And even if I feel irate at such injustices, I’m relieved; it feels good for a woman to be talking about the issues covered by her set so confidently, so critically, so fearlessly.</p><p>Friedman’s comedy isn’t nice, but why should it be? Opening with gentler Brexit-talk before moving on to scathing but fantastic breakdowns of US abortion law, femicide rates, and the spectre of miscarriage in casual discourse, Friedman’s foci are difficult but crucial. With such intense subject matter inevitably come some uncomfortable moments. Friedman herself noted a few longer, slightly shocked pauses before laughter; she’s a little surprised that her UK audience’s typical humour isn’t as pitch-dark as usual, but takes this in her stride. Her audience interaction is as relentless as her laugh-rate, too—Friedman isn’t afraid to force her spotlight on those present or react to their responses. Confrontations with the men in the room offer some especially acerbic highlights, but as with most of her material, they nearly always feel necessary.</p><p><i>Miscarriage of Justice </i>was a surprise to me; I went in knowing little about Friedman, not knowing what to expect. But it was shocking and motivating. I didn’t realise how much I needed to hear Friedman’s perspective. This show isn’t a haven for the faint-hearted, but some of the best comedy makes you confront challenging issues. Everybody should hear what Friedman has to say – it’s urgent, essential, and pretty damn funny.</p><p>TW: this show contains mentions of rape and sexual assault, death, fascism and Nazism, white supremacy, femicide, gun violence, miscarriage, and misogyny.</p><p>Jena Friedman: Miscarriage of Justice runs at Assembly George Square Studio Five at 21:20 until 25th August.</p>",

Not only did I find her subject matter comically apt for myself, but I’m a sucker for any kind of PowerPoint backdrop, so the moment I saw a screen emblazoned with a distinctly stock image of smiling, happy, and excessively polite people, I knew I was in for a good time.</p><p>An extremely high-energy start, replete with a fantastic (and hilariously fitting) walk-out song, was followed by an equally animated set. Friends pop up in well-timed video interludes to recount their worst, funniest manners-based kerfuffles: from waving to the bus driver who ran into you to tales of excruciatingly awkward prostate exams, <i>Polite Club </i>has it all.</p><p>The packed audience didn’t take long to warm up, either, thanks to Mant’s confident, skilful building of smaller observational bits around her broader, contemplative questions. Relationship issues were at the core of <i>Polite Club, </i>but weren’t hugely clichéd – instead, they were viewed through the lens of her manners: did many of her past relationships stumble because her partners were all terrible people, Mant asks, or was her characteristic niceness to blame?</p><p>Between impromptu, crease-worthy dance numbers and a final, ridiculous climax, Mant throws herself into <i>Polite Club, </i>and it really pays off. By the show’s end, the audience were in her pocket, and so was I; I especially loved the moments focusing on a dolphin-voiced careers coach, Mant’s impression of which is a real highlight, as well as her creative use of certain male celebrities.</p><p><i>Polite Club </i>is imaginative, energetic, and simply good fun. And to top it off, I now have a fitting mandate for all those like Mant and I, who find ourselves stuck because we’re too damn polite. A motto for these troubled times: embrace your inner, sweary Australian dad.</p><p>Izzy Mant: Polite Club runs at Dexter Room, Underbelly Bristo Square at 14:50 until 26th August.</p>",

Armed with a keyboard, a ridiculously voluminous wig, a shed-load of diamante, and a chilling hypothesis — Ed Sheeran’s brand of tropical house may just be <i>unstoppable </i>— the duo pack the hour-long show with a frankly dangerous amount of laughs and hit comical peaks as astronomically high as Ariana Grande’s whistle tone.</p><p>The essence of Grande herself is something that Frisky and Mannish take aim at in their scientific riffs. But don’t worry if you’ve avoided being initiated into Grande’s pop-cult thus far – there’s material suitable for everyone here. From Bo’ Selecta jokes to an unforgettable re-interpretation of Bruno Mars (with some pit-stops mocking Moby along the way), <i>PopLab</i>’s experiments span a huge swathe of musical history. Nobody is safe from their microscopic melodic probing—not even 90s Celt-pop icons The Corrs (a reference that, I have to admit, I quietly screamed at in the moment). Music lovers will be in their element, but you don’t have to know much about music to thoroughly enjoy the show, either. Upon leaving, I only heard one person mention that they didn’t get one of the musical references. The diverse audience ate each set up, especially loving<i> </i>the simple-yet-inspired audience interaction, a genius riff on Rickrolling.</p><p><i>PopLab</i> is possibly the best, most entertaining show I’ll see at Fringe, and we’re barely a few days into August. Alongside possessing brilliant musical talent, the duo absolutely know their stuff about music, and about how to make people laugh—it’s why they can improvise and entertain so, so well. Ridiculous, bizarre, and hilarious, Frisky and Mannish have outdone themselves for their tenth Fringe anniversary. Their energy and obvious adoration for everything pop is electric; <i>PopLab </i>channels this perfectly. Go.</p><p>Frisky and Mannish’s PopLab runs at Spiegeltent Palace du Variete at 7pm until 25th August.</p>",

      "title": "ALASKALASKA Review",
      "html": "<p>Alaskalaska is a British band that was formed in 2016 when Lucinda Duarte-Holman (lead singer, guitarist and songwriter), Fraser Rieley (bassist and producer), and Calum Duncan (guitarist) were studying pop music at Goldsmiths University.  They were then joined by saxophonist Fraser Smith and drummer Gethin Jones. The band has spent the last few years curating a sound that is unique and replayable. They refuse to be categorized and refuse to streamline the way we think about difficult topics. Through not simplifying complicated concepts and taking advantage of the freedom granted by not being confined to a certain genre, ALASKALASKA released one of the most sonically and lyrically ambitious albums of 2019.  I had the opportunity to meet with the band before their show at The Hug and Pint in Glasgow.</p><p>The Dots is a follow up to their 2017 self-titled EP.  The album benefits from having time to experiment with broader sounds and subjects.  According to Calum, “When you’re releasing singles and EPs, it’s not a lot of space to work with. So whether consciously or not, you're thinking like you want to win people over.  You feel the need to sum yourself up in a little four minute, five minute chunk of time.” He explained the benefits of making an album, “When you make a record, in 45 minutes to an hour you can do loads of stuff.  There’s a song on the record called Sweat - it’s a lot of people’s favorites it’s probably my favorite as well - it’s something that’s hard to get away with on an EP…. Because, you can actually get a bit of time to reflect on it, work out what you sound like.  That’s why an album is really good, and that’s why it’s still such a relevant format.”</p><p>Narratively, each song makes sense as a standalone, but contributes more to the overarching theme.  The album plays like a series of reactions to complex concepts and the questions they introduce. ‘The Dots’, the album’s introduction track, plays a conversation where Lucinda sings “lover, boy I’ve had a rough day / That ole' muscle in my chest, can you take it away? / So easy to get caught up, stuck repeating the same phase / Remembering to join up the dots before I lose my way.”  After a tough day, Lucinda reminds herself to connect the dots.</p><p>These “dots” are the topics of each of the album’s songs, and Lucinda sees their connection as her story.  She expands this, “I think there’s a bit of a story that connects the dots... it’s as simple as that really.  I mean most of the songs are about my experience over the last two or three years... Like you know there’s this weird balancing thing where we’re constantly trying to piece together and connect one bit to another…. It’s always connected in some way...   Constantly remind yourself. The actual song ‘The Dots’ is about that. It goes full circle.”</p><p>‘Meateater’ begins with Lucinda clarifying the band’s philosophy with a single idea.  “Put me in this box like you always do, lock it up”. She sings about the idea of being pigeonholed, and follows with a confused reaction to why we try to constrict others.  She later sings, “Cruel so cruel / it’s black and white and it’s feeling good / so how did you find that being?” Lucinda asserts that binary terms can appease the stress or tension caused by a situation’s complexity, but it’s inhumane. She then questions the origins of this thought process.  The rejection of simplification doesn’t just apply to how ALASKALASKA is viewed, but to how they view the world around them. This makes ‘Meateater” the perfect lead single.</p><p>The busier songs on The Dots present an interesting juxtaposition of lighter sounding tracks with heavy subjects.  ‘Moon’, a song about navigating difficult PMS, is infectiously danceable. Lucinda speaks on this juxtaposition, “It’s nice to surprise people.  It’s also nice to have that deeper meaning, but it’s not like you have to read into that meaning if you don’t want to. Have a dance if you want to have a dance.  It’s a fun contrast.” Fraser chimes in, “I think it’s important to have something people can enjoy on different levels if they want to... Hopefully they’ll just listen to all of it and enjoy it. That usually doesn’t happen.  It’s hard to find the balance between making something that you’re proud of and is relevant and unique.”</p><p>‘Bees’ presents this juxtaposition with its music video. It features cat videos amongst other meme-like clips yet is about the cyclical nature of consumerism.  These clips are a light way to present and clarify the song’s more urgent message. Lucinda explains, “I wanted the lyrics to be very backed up by the imagery as well.  I wanted that to be very, poignant…. There are a lot of cats in there. It’s a contrast between this really serious stuff going on and having the comic video backing it up.”  The video’s imagery both clarifies the song’s message to continue questioning our actions as consumers and makes it digestible by featuring goofy videos, without undermining the subject’s complexity.</p><p>ALASKALASKA is confident in their musical identity, even when dipping their toes in different genres.  They actually find comfort in not being confined. When discussing genres, Calum asserts, “It doesn’t matter.  Unless you’re in HMV looking for a record, it doesn’t matter. It’s more of a categorization thing That’s the only use it has really.  And there’s always a danger of sounding too contrived if you try to aim the band to firmly in one place.” Not identifying with a genre has given the band more freedom to experiment in the recording process.  Lucinda chimes in, “It was encouraged if you’ve got an idea, just throw it in, try it! We joke about a sample or baseline, but let’s try it. Do it! It’s fun. It just makes it a bit more exciting.”</p><p>Their confidence allows them to not know exactly where they’re going, but play around until they’re happy with the outcome.  Fraser believes, “(the sound) always diverges. I think you’d be kind of stupid to not let that happen…. Songs evolve and sounds either get more or less interesting as time goes on so you always go off the path.”  There’s no formula to their music other than finding what works for the five of them. Lucinda says, “It’s about what works with everyone else. That’s the main thing: us working together to make whatever it is we want to make together.”</p><p>Lucinda explains how a project helped her understand their musical identity, “When we were studying, for one of our modules we did this thing where we basically had to do covers.  One of my teachers said something that I thought was really interesting: that you really learn something about yourself by covering another person’s song. You’re thinking about how you would do the song.  You get this kind of openness to it like you’re giving it exactly what you think is right for that song. Not like this is a soul song so I’m going to do a soul cover. It’s your interpretation of it. It’s what makes you the artist.  It’s okay to do that, it’s good, it’s fun. Be creative.” This is apparent on ALASKALASKA’s cover of Edwyn Collins’ ‘A Girl Like You’. The cover sounds nothing like the original while having their funky, catchy, synth-heavy influence all over it, fully showcasing the band’s identity.</p><p>Their willingness to experiment and reject genre-conforming norms may lead one to think their album would be chaotic, but The Dots surprises with a cohesive sound and narrative.  Their smooth transitions back and forth from jazzy riffs to poppy synths, and beautiful overlapping moments, allow the album to sound diverse yet unified.  No track feels out of place, although it never feels like ALASKALASKA does the same thing twice. ‘Sweat’ is a minimal, stripped down song about intimacy. Its straightforwardness complements busier songs like ‘Meateater’, ‘Moon’, and ‘Bees’, which bounce between poppy synths and jazzy saxophone sessions.</p><p>ALASKALASKA’s The Dots feels like the start of something special, while also the culmination of years spent experimenting to find a unique sonic identity.  The band thrives when they’re doing their own thing. They make you dance to a song about PMS. They have you thinking about consumer behavior while watching a clip of the infamous ‘Spider-Man pointing at himself’ meme.  They transition from a pop song to a saxophone solo with ease. The Dots is the product of accepting a philosophy of experimenting and throwing any genre-conforming behavior out the window.  As Lucinda asserted on ‘Meateater’, they don’t want to be put in a box, and if The Dots is what happens when they reject traditional placement and structure, HMV is going to have a difficult time figuring where to place more timeless works.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/215/content_ALSKALASKA.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure>",

It seems he has it all figured out; but navigating first-impressions at a new job is somewhat tricky when you are a gay man with cerebral palsy. Oh, and he has just been hit by a car.</p><p>At a lunch-date with new co-worker (and soon-to-be spirit animal) Kim (Punam Patel), Ryan begins to discuss his accident when Kim puts the pieces together – a skewed limp when walking and a vehicular collision? Got it. In fact, so seamless is the connection that there really is no need to explain in more detail why his hand-eye coordination doesn’t lend itself well to opening letters. Besides – cerebral palsy doesn’t define a person, right?</p><p><em>Special</em> is a refreshingly sophisticated look at intersectionality and millennial culture. As a semi-autobiographical piece, creator and actor Ryan O’Connell brings a unique and unrivalled honesty to his performance – navigating the pitfalls of prejudice with nuance and pride. He defies the norm through his depiction of <em>that</em> sex scene; portraying queer relations without the cinematic heteronormativity intrinsic to the classic moonlit pan-away camera movement.</p><p>So truthful are his observations that the blind date scene with his boss’ deaf cousin makes for ecstatic viewing. When Ryan is confronted by disability, he is taken aback at the audacity to pair two people together in such a (clearly) discriminatory way. But when the concept of internalized ableism is thrown at Ryan in response to his questionable behaviour, he is forced to face his own preconceptions. He has cerebral palsy – surely that makes him immune or something?</p><p>With astonishingly profound character development, <em>Special</em> ventures where no other show has done before. Witty, bold and triumphant from its concept through its execution: if TV has a canon, add it to the list.</p><p><em>Special </em>is available to stream on Netflix now.</p>",

Matilda is a genius and without an appropriate outlet for her intelligence, finds herself able to move things with her eyes. Matilda’s tale is intertwined with that of an acrobat and his wife which leads to many a plot twist in the second act.</p><p>Whilst the show is based on Roald Dahl’s children’s book, it is certainly enjoyable for adults as well, with the opening number, 'Miracle', immediately engages the humour of all generations in the audience. The child actors are exceptionally talented and steal the show; at many points outshining the adult actors. Scarlett Cecil as Matilda, despite being tiny in comparison to the huge theatre, commands full attention of the audience in her first solo, 'Naughty', and continues to shine throughout the rest of the production. The other children are also very impressive: especially Toby Hales as Eric and Lily Van Veer as Lavender.</p><p>Amongst the grown-ups, Elliot Harper plays frightening-but-witty Miss Trunchbull. The characterisation of Miss Trunchbull is somewhat reminiscent of a pantomime style if more sophisticated, affording the audience both laughter and grimace. Rebecca Thornhill and Sebastian Torkia successfully capture the essence of Matilda’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood, who are very much caricatures in their dominating personas.</p><p>All of the children are exceptionally talented singers and dancers. They stand out in every number, but special mention must go to the song 'Revolting Children', in which their talents are truly showcased. Peter Darling's outstanding choreography makes the show what it is, and with the visual talents of Hugh Vanstone in his lighting design, <em>Matilda The Musical</em> is a delight.</p><p><em>Matilda The Musical </em>runs at the Edinburgh Playhouse until Saturday 27th April 2019.</p>",

Gus (Levi Mattey), a gay white male artist, is excluded from the exhibition by senior curator Jane (Jess Butcher), who is looking for new voices – not ‘white dudes’. Gus hires Vanessa (Anna Phillips), a black actress, to present his art as the fictional artist ‘Balkonaé Townsend’. The two construct her parodical and stereotyped context – she’s a feminist, lesbian vegan ‘blafrican American’, and painter of self-proclaimed ‘bad-b*tch expressionism’. Townsend’s persona soon takes on a life of her own, escalating to the play’s dramatic finale.</p><p>The satire tackles race, gender, intersectionality, and art, forcing the audience to interrogate how their own everyday assumptions and interactions create restrictive identities. Through Gus, his Asian boyfriend Tanner (Bradley Butler), Vanessa, and Jane, we explore hierarchies of domination, questioning whether any pain or experience can be commonly experienced.</p><p>The EUTC’s production at St. Cecilia’s Hall is the UK debut for Philadelphia playwright James Ijames’ play. The music museum is the ideal venue, the audience surrounding the stage to obtain a shared understanding from all four characters’ points of view. The pared-back, white staging and props – only ever moved by Gus – serve as a reminder that the social environment is defined by white narratives, accepted as the default.</p><p>Though primarily focussed on race and sexuality, Ijames’ writing extends beyond these issues to consider how we construct our own and others’ identities. Gus claims that the white and gay elements of himself are in a conversation where neither listens to the other. Perhaps the most captivating acting comes from Phillips’ final scene, as she glitches and snaps between the different facets of her own personality.</p><p><em>White</em> also taps into a debate I’ve recently been exploring – whether art can be separated from the artist. As Townsend herself is the ultimate artwork, the piece created by the prejudices and assumptions of her own society, one expects not.</p><p>Run ended.</p>",

This conversation between the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra and Arild Andersen, Tommy Smith and Paolo Vinaccia, over 4 different pieces, really showcased the explorations of contemporary jazz.</b></p><p><b>Arild Andersen began the story with a beautiful composition of bass harmonics; the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra gradually weaved its way into the sound before unleashing its full force. The real excitement, however, came with the array of fantastic solos, the first of these being on the trombone. All I can say is who would have thought the trombone would be capable of a bebop-esque scat? The speed and melody he brought to the trombone was unreal and I’ve never seen someone get so many notes out of a trombone so quickly. To follow was an amazing percussion solo: if you’ve ever been given the shaker to play in the school orchestra and thought it was a dud role, percussionist Paolo Vinaccia will most definitely make you think again. This insane percussion solo, performed using only his hands, involving a one minute interlude using only a shaker, was mastery and the dramatic interplay between him and the bass made for a mesmerizing climax to their performance.</b></p><p><b>The only thing I could critique would be the venue: it felt as though it didn’t do such an exciting performance justice and perhaps a more playful venue would have better complimented the excitement of the performance. It felt a bit like watching Nirvana play at the Royal Opera House: jazz isn’t something old and fragile and shouldn’t be treated as something that is. Perhaps, maybe, this is a reason why not many young people aren’t or think they aren’t in to jazz, which is a shame. So, maybe a more relaxed venue would have attracted a more mixed crowd.</b></p><p><b>Overall, it was a wonderfully back-to-front masterpiece where the trumpets and piano held the beat , whilst the bassist and the trombonist took centre stage and showed us what amazing rhythmic and melodic talent their instruments are capable of. It had the charm of classical jazz whilst being enticing and contemporary at the same time.</b></p>",

Gus (Levi Mattey), a gay white male artist, is excluded from the exhibition by senior curator Jane (Jess Butcher), who is looking for new voices – not ‘white dudes’. Gus hires Vanessa (Anna Phillips), a black actress, to present his art as the fictional artist ‘Balkonaé Townsend’. The two construct her parodical and stereotyped context – she’s a feminist, lesbian vegan ‘blafrican American’, and painter of self-proclaimed ‘bad bitch expressionism’. Townsend’s persona soon takes on a life of her own, escalating to the play’s dramatic finale.</p><p>The satire tackles race, gender, intersectionality, and art, forcing the audience to interrogate how their own everyday assumptions and interactions create restrictive identities. Through Gus, his Asian boyfriend Tanner (Bradley Butler), Vanessa, and Jane, we explore hierarchies of domination, questioning whether any pain or experience can be commonly experienced.</p><p>The EUTC’s production at St. Cecilia’s Hall is the UK debut for Philadelphia playwright James Ijames’ play. The music museum is the ideal venue, the audience surrounding the stage to obtain a shared understanding from all four characters’ points of view. The pared-back, white staging and props – only ever moved by Gus – serve as a reminder that the social environment is defined by white narratives, accepted as the default.</p><p>Though primarily focussed on race and sexuality, Ijames’ writing extends beyond these issues to consider how we construct our own and others’ identities. Gus claims that the white and gay elements of himself are in a conversation where neither listens to the other. Perhaps the most captivating acting comes from Phillips’ final scene, as she glitches and snaps between the different facets of her own personality.</p><p><i>WHITE </i>also taps into a debate I’ve recently been exploring – whether art can be separated from the artist. As Townsend herself is the ultimate artwork, the piece created by the prejudices and assumptions of her own society, one expects not.</p><p><i>WHITE </i>runs at St. Cecilia’s Hall until Monday 25th March 2019.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/Xp9Ou0zl2j.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>It’s been eighteen months since <i>Blue Planet II </i>first aired on BBC, the series attracting equally high praise for its footage as its stunning music, composed by film score-veteran Hans Zimmer. The two unite live in concert by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Matthew Freeman, and a 4k Ultra HD LED screen.</p><p>Glasgow’s SSE Hydro was the ideal venue, beyond its own watery nomenclature. We were greeted with a giant revolving projection of the endlessly blue planet. From the darkness colours exploded onto the screen, as the orchestra erupted into its cinematic introduction.</p><p>I sat mouth agape for most of the performance. The live music only heightened the suspense of the footage, which had already left me on the edge of my seat watching from my flat’s 24-inch screen. We meet saddleback clownfish working in teams to move a giant shell. Their black and white appearance is accompanied by equally eerie music. Yet, when the female finally lays her bright eggs (much closer to the infamous Nemo-orange), the orchestra is lit in a matching hue, responding with triumphant fanfare.</p><p>The tension continually grows. Giant trevally launch themselves from the water to swallow fledgling birds whole. Hunting orca render their prey unconscious with a co-ordinated hammer blows. A lion fish is snatched into the abyss by a Bobbit worm, rising like a <i>Little Shop of Horrors </i>plant from the violins to consume its prey. As the fish blow on to the sand, directly onto the band below, the woodwind replies in kind. It’s a moment of perfect audio and visual unity.</p><p>Zimmer’s seamless transitions between moods narrate the creatures’ storylines, each theme layered in anticipation of the next change. We question whether the music or footage was created first (our suspicions confirmed, it’s the latter), as the two fit together so perfectly. In keeping with the audio-visual harmony, the audience unites behind the more courageous creatures. The crowd raucously cheers when a puffin escapes an epic dogfight with a skua over a piece of fish to feed its pufflings. Keen Attenboroughers are reminded of the ‘iguana vs. snakes’ moment from <i>Planet Earth II.</i></p><p>Despite Rani’s best efforts, Attenborough’s narrative absence was certainly felt. We agree a more vocally-distinctive narrator might have better filled the void left by the voice of the series. Nevertheless, the series’ overarching message of human responsibility certainly hits home. The production follows sustainable practices, promoting recyclable ‘Just Water’ bottles and reducing CO2 emissions from their tour vehicles.</p><p>Perhaps the most impressive moment takes place in the darkest depths of the ocean, featuring the now infamous ‘brine pool of death’. It looks like outer space – Rani reminds us that four times more people have visited the moon than waters so deep. This scene especially stands out for its superbly co-ordinated staging, tech, and lighting.</p><p>Amidst calls for ‘one more tuna’, the orchestra encores to the triumphant flute trills synonymous with the series soundtrack, haunting live choral singing, and the giant blue orb. We leave reminded of our own individual insignificance, but collective power to affect our beautiful blue planet.</p>",

However, this wasn't a gig that I'd want to miss for a simple illness. If anything, it might just cure me.</p><p>Preceded by the rest of her band, Amber bounces on stage to the roar of her adoring fans, wearing a big smile that she maintains during the majority of the set. And what’s not to smile about? Her now month-old album 'Good At Falling' has achieved large commercial and critical successes, taking her work to new heights having spent 4 years releasing assorted EPs and singles. Either that or the fact that her dog was also in attendance, surely very comforting for a musician on a tour.</p><p>Each track is met with a collective swoon from the crowd and every lyric is sung word for word. It’s a dynamic that differs incredibly from listening alone, a powerful testament to the sheer depth of emotion attached to Bain’s lyrics with their carefully crafted soundscapes, made even more ethereal as they fill the beautiful stone arches of The Caves. And Amber seems to be enjoying herself as much as the spectators, cheekily smiling and occasionally twisting her mic so that the youthful throng at the front can be heard belting out everything from infectious banger 'Maybe You’re The Reason' to the slower and slightly more reflective rendition of 'Saw You In A Dream'. A particular highlight would be an almost effortless transition from the eerie yet intricate introduction of 'Sister' into newer track 'Everybody Hates Me Now', a beautifully poignant piece that is as introspective and emotive as The Japanese House have ever been, and as familiar to the crowd as any older track.</p><p>The eloquence with which older and more recent tracks combine within the set is outstanding, highlighting an emotional maturity that has developed through her four EPs and particularly now in her new album, a work that largely deals with coping with the struggles of heartbreak. It brings back emotions not felt since being at sixth form, showing, to myself at least, a personal progression that has been lived through her stunning music.</p><p>Throughout the set she doesn’t speak all that much, at one point to tell a fan that she doesn’t have a pen on her to sign the record they lift up. After finishing up the fifteen song set with sprightly indie-bop 'Clean', the band leave without an encore, leaving some disappointment yet not enough to quash the general feeling of content that sits amongst the crowd like a wave of sunshine.</p><p>Bearing witness to one of my favourite artists in such a gorgeous setting is a privilege that no sore head would ever impair. Like a hot cup of tea and a big hug from your mam, the enigmatic sound of the Japanese House cleanses the soul and reassures you that everything will be ok, whilst at the same time taking you on a reflective emotional journey in which you are rid of your worries and fears. A must-see live.</p>",

Felix Rackow had the chance to sit down with her and discuss everything from cheese toasties to tattoos, before she played a sell-out show at Glasgow’s Barrowland Ballroom on the 15<sup>th</sup> March 2019…</i></b></p><p><b>Hello Dodie! So, this is the third night of the tour, how do you think it’s going?</b></p><p>(Dodie counts on her fingers) Wait, Bristol, Birmingham, Glasgow… yes! It’s going really well! Bristol; the first show, was really good, it was so fun… Birmingham I was having a few technical worries, and giant career doubts… I don’t know… it just happens when you’re facing it every day, but then playing the shows it’s… it’s so, so good.</p><p><b>And how was playing in Europe – was it different to the UK?</b></p><p>The shows were a teeny bit smaller, but honestly it’s a very familiar vibe – I think I’m a bit more patriotic than perhaps I first thought… (we laugh) because it's always nice to play in England, but I think the crowds have a very familiar vibe…</p><p><b>It must be a big adjustment being on tour, I’m sure – are there any things that you’ve learned to deal with, any tips and tricks that you’d give?</b></p><p>Yes! It’s hard to find a place by yourself on tour, because you’re constantly surrounded by people; and I do love that because I’m someone who feeds off of other people’s energy and my friends’ energy – but sometimes I just need some time alone. So yes! Find a secret spot for a secret cry!</p><p><b>I know you do ‘Tour Court’ every morning on the bus…</b></p><p>Well! Not every morning – we’ve been a bit slack lately but we are due one quite soon!</p><p><b>Can you remember what the worst ‘fine’ given out at ‘Tour Court’ was?</b></p><p>I’m probably going to get one soon because I recently made myself a delicious cheese toastie – we have a George Foreman, but we call him the George ‘Tourman’ (we both roll our eyes), and I opened it up and it slid right out onto the floor, so I might get one for that soon. But I can’t think of a really bad one – probably when Ross couldn’t hear the click in his ears (we have a click track) and he was signalling like ‘please, I can’t hear the click!’ and then he picked up his cable and it just wasn’t plugged into his pack…</p><p><b>Moving onto your EP, which the tour is obviously based on – it’s had a really big reaction and you even did a Radio One Piano Session, how have you found that?</b></p><p>I mean, that’s amazing, that’s so so cool and I really appreciate all the support that Radio One have given me – it’s insane. To be honest though I don’t really mind so much about the outwards things – obviously it’s really nice if I get a good review or if ‘mainstreamy’ people pay attention to me, but I think today I’m thinking more about the negative side of that – for example the mainstream take on coming from YouTube is a little… different…</p><p><b>And I was going to say as well – I don’t think that mainstream pop necessarily ‘likes’ the topics that you talk about – how have you found that; has that been difficult?</b></p><p>Yeah – I got a review today that said something about my set being ‘bleak’… (we laugh) and honestly I have had that worry! I was thinking that perhaps I write too many sad songs but whenever I say that to my friends or my fans they say that that’s what they like, and that’s why they’re there – they connect to that. You just have to ignore other people’s perceptions and write what you know.</p><p><b>You’re known for being very open and very honest, which is fantastic, but it’s surely a very one-sided dialogue with you and the listener/audience – are there any difficulties with that? Do you find that difficult to navigate?</b></p><p>Yeah. Yeah, I mean… I don’t know… I guess it is kind of two-sided because you do get to hear other people’s opinions. I mean, obviously I think when I’m talking about these kinds of topics people want to also talk back about their own struggles… For them it’s like one person talking to them but for me its thousands of people talking to me about their ‘bad brains’ and I can’t take all of that! I don’t know, we just kind of work it through as best we can… I read letters when I can, when I’m able, and social media…</p><p><b>You’ve got to close yourself off haven’t you…</b></p><p>Yeah…</p><p><b>Coming back to the EP! There are loads of great collaborations on there – you’ve got Lewis Watson, Tom Walker… Is there anyone else you want to collaborate with in the future?</b></p><p>I don’t know! I’d love to work with some female musicians… I’m the biggest Emily King fan and I’d love to work with her… I think I’d probably cry and just want to bow at her feet!</p><p><b>And Orla Gartland – how is it working with her?</b></p><p>Amazing! She’s awesome! Oh my god we should totally do a track together! That’s just hit me – oh my gosh! No, she’s awesome, she’s just the coolest person I know and her song-writing is amazing… I’ve said it before but if you get someone to support you who you’re a fan of you just get to watch your favourite person play every night which is awesome.</p><p><b>So finally, your song <em>Party Tattoos</em> is one of my favourites and you’ve got some brilliant tattoos already, but if there was one more that you could get what would it be?</b></p><p>I don’t know! We have a tour tradition of doing a tattoo on every tour – we didn’t do one for Europe but I think we could combine these two tours together… I don’t know – I think I might get one of a full moon… that might be really lame…</p><p><b>Surely that would just be a circle?</b></p><p>(We laugh) Yeah… I know… But I saw the blood-red wolf-moon that happened recently – I got up at 4AM to go and see it with my friends and I walked outside and it creeped me out so much… It was just so round, and there, and it just looked like a planet in the sky which was really strange… It just freaked me out but in a good way… It reminded me that I’m on the Earth and I thought that was really cool.. So yeah! Maybe a moon – who knows!</p><p><b>That would be cool! Thank you so much Dodie!</b></p><p>No worries!</p><p><b><i>Dodie is currently touring the UK, culminating in a sold-out show at London’s Roundhouse on the 24<sup>th</sup> March. She recently toured Europe, and will travel to the US to play 22 dates in the Autumn. Her book, ‘Secrets For The Mad’ was also released in 2017.</i></b></p>",

When the Angels decide to close Heaven so that they may have unshared access to its glories, it seems the dead are left in limbo. But when the whiskey is flowing and the band is playing – who would choose to reside anywhere other than the soil?</p><p>The plot follows the narrative of the youthfully-dead John (Malcolm Cumming), whose untimely death is devastatingly clouded by historical legislation that outlawed his love for then-boyfriend: now, an old man who still makes daily visits to John’s grave. Guided by the sharp-tongued but ultimately compassionate dealings of Mrs. Mark (Ann Louise Ross), John enlists the help of new resident Little Annie (Olivia Barrowclough) to make contact with the world above and bring closure to the man whose unfounded guilt has haunted him for a lifetime.</p><p>Kenneth MacLeod’s set design is as morbid as it is delectable, presenting the soil as a topsy-turvy amalgamation of Victorian steampunk coffins and household ornaments. High above the cold depths of the earth stands a neon-rimmed window, affording glimpses into the living world and the heights of Heaven as though through a TV screen. The grandeur of the set comes not only from its size: instead, there are a myriad of interesting and unusual levels that make for a particularly interesting use of staging. Accompanied by Simon Wilkinson’s’ equally innovative lighting design, the entire production is enchanted by a hauntingly intriguing aesthetic.</p><p>Biff Smith has a great deal of expectation preceding him – as the leader (and songwriter) of the soil’s resident band, he is tasked with bringing life to an otherwise particularly dead locality. His headship is at once charismatic and unnerving: with his purple-lipped jazzy vocals contextualising our induction into the afterlife and the cadaverous ventures of its inhabitants.</p><p>The Dark Carnival is a masterful representation of the power of gig theatre; guiding us into the dark and cobwebbed ground below which we stand. Defiant in its morbidity and triumphant in its execution – it would seem that perhaps death isn’t the end, after all.</p><p><em>The Dark Carnival </em>runs at the Traverse Theatre until Saturday 9th March 2019.<br></p>",

That version of the play was updated for a modern audience, and this version, directed by Shilpa T-Hyland and ending a short tour at Edinburgh’s Studio Theatre is similarly adapted, this time by Zinnie Harris, who grounds the classic in 1920s Scotland amid the General Strike which affected the entirety of the UK. Jen McGinley’s set draws the audience in even before the performance begins, as does Hyland’s decision to place the brilliant Helen Mackay, playing Christine, visibly on stage as we enter, establishing firmly her social position before any words have even been said. The set itself also establishes the sense of social hierarchy which is so key to the plot, with the supposed grandeur of the house above contrasting with the claustrophobia of the kitchen amidst the visible servant bells and domestic utensils.</p><p>After a slightly slow start, the vast majority of the acting in this three-hander is focussed and fast-paced, particularly during the brief moments when all three characters appear at the same time, when John’s mixed loyalties are fascinating to observe. As John, Lorn Macdonald is for most part enthralling, although at a couple of moments seems perhaps to lack total authenticity. Macdonald plays John’s youthful masculinity well, however it is the moments of vulnerability where he is at his best. Similarly, Hiftu Quasem is sincere and often compelling as the title role, playing a Julie who entices confidently but is at the same time unsure of herself and of what she wants. It is definitely Mackay, however, who stands out, portraying a Christine whose unwavering emotional intelligence and composure resonates with the audience far more than the unpredictability and irresponsibility of the other two characters. It would be easy to play Christine as angry and bitter, but Mackay’s earnest characterisation suggests something far deeper than this that resounds even after the curtain has come down.</p><p>Harris’ adaptation for the majority of the evening serves to give the play a confident new life, finding a voice which not only reflects 1920s struggles but highlights themes which are still relevant today. Despite this, there are a few moments which seem perhaps to be slightly miscalculated; particularly the repeated throwing of a wet cloth at Julie, which seems out of place somehow in a script which at all other times conveys convincingly the passions of the individuals involved. This adaptation, then, for the most part enthrals, and at just over an hour and a half makes for a pacey and thoroughly enjoyable evening.</p><p><em>Miss Julie </em>runs at The Studio until Saturday 9th March 2019.  <br></p>",

But when the star entertainer becomes pregnant, aspiring philanthropist Baby Houseman does all she can to help – even if that involves learning how to dance and taking to the stage so her friend can take the time off for medical assistance. As the sweat begins to form and the day of the performance approaches, Baby finds herself entranced by her new partner, Johnny. As their relationship progresses and familial tensions rise, anything is possible but only one thing is certain – nobody puts Baby in a corner.</p><p>Roberto Comotti’s cartoonish set design aptly contextualises the viscid insipidness of the American Summer ideology – with a picture-perfect caricature of the Kellerman’s restaurant taking centre stage amongst an over-green and perfectly manicured forest. Though Valerio Tiberi’s projection design has similar qualities, it soon ventures into the absurdist: in particular, the infamous lake scene (realized through carefully positioned back lighting and a cartoon lake projected onto the upstage scrim) is made laughable through the childish qualities of its aesthetics.</p><p>With such a large ensemble cast, there is a certain disappointment in the under-utilization of their talents. With a distinct lack of singing, there is no compensation afforded by an increased frequency of full-stage dance numbers. In fact, scenes are largely fragmented – with clunky set pieces brought on for inconsequential segments of narrative to play out. Nevertheless, there is plenty of joy to be found in the finale – even if the rest of the production is at risk of becoming its warm-up.</p><p>Kira Malou brings a sense of humour to Baby, which serves as an endearing addition to the more tender moments in which she and Johnny become acquainted. Michael O’Reilly’s dancing abilities are showcased excellently as Johnny, but there is an air of uncomfortableness to be found in their romantic journey together – something that most certainly isn’t helped by the sporadic tonality of Eleanor Bergstein’s script.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is more than enough raw talent to compensate for any creative oversights: a pleasant production, even if unfulfilled in its potential.</p><p><em>Dirty Dancing </em>runs at the Festival Theatre until Saturday 9th March 2019. <br>    <br></p>",

As his condition degenerates, it seems the only thing able to bring him out of his condition temporarily and evoke memories of the distant past is Frank Sinatra’s music: the soundtrack to their first encounter with one another.</p><p>Jane is forced with the reality of her relationship’s metamorphosis; slowly but surely undergirding the ties of love with those of responsibility. Angela Hardie is as convincing as heart-breaking in her negotiation of such an unchartered emotional terrain. Her unassuming relatability serves to confront the audience with their own rhetoric potential – forcing them to place themselves in the situation and to consider their own approach.</p><p>Matthew Seager’s script is nuanced and moving; excellently portraying the emotional rhetoric that surrounds the medical diagnosis, both for Arthur and Jane – both affected but equally alone because of it. He is similarly impressive in his portrayal of Arthur, and effortlessly manipulates the demarcated boundaries of chronology to present Arthur in many stages of life.</p><p>There is a hollow beauty to the moments in which Frank Sinatra’s music plays, when Will Alder and Iida Aino’s lighting design starkly represents a change in narrative – taking us back to Jane and Arthur’s early days together, before the diagnosis of MCI (mild cognitive impairment) challenged their future together. As their demeanour changes, we are allowed to get to know the individuals on their own terms: separated from the labels of the disease that too often works to define people. It is a true testament to the power of music, and the ways in which memory and understanding are articulated.</p><p>Though pacing sometimes has the tendency to err on the side of over-indulgence, <em>In Other Words</em> is an emotive exploration of the intricacies of Alzheimer’s disease; fleshing out its stereotypes with the lived, social experiences of its victims.</p><p><em>Run ended.</em></p>",

As the loved-up Molly and Sam move into a new apartment, it seems that their life together is just starting. But tragedy strikes as Sam is shot dead in the street, leaving Molly all alone. But Sam – trapped between this world and the next – discovers that perhaps his death was not coincidental, and that Molly is in danger. With the help of a (apparently not-so) fake psychic, Sam must change the course of the living world in order to facilitate his own entry into the next.</p><p>Nick Richings' lighting design is unrestricted in its opportunity to transcend the world we are used to, but unfortunately relies on incongruous gimmicks to represent the blur between life and death. A mirage of rippling hues unintentionally seems to locate the scenes of New York underwater, and the decision to illuminate the skyline upstage with crass neon lights is reminiscent of a school disco.</p><p>Choreography by Alistair David is clearly intended to be modern – taking the mould of abstract ensemble movements that aim to contextualise the sappiness of the narrative in urban, grittier peripheries. In the blur of manual set changes required by a touring production, however, it soon becomes out of place – not dissimilar to intentionally ‘edgy’ stereotypes encompassing teenage acting showcases.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are strong individual performances from Rebekah Lowing’s Molly, who shines past the confines of the production design and holds the inconsistencies of tone together with the sheer power of her voice. Niall Sheehy as Sam is equally impressive, bringing a sentimentality to a character with whom we have had no time to connect, rendering his death a tragedy.</p><p>With an enjoyable – if perhaps indistinguishable – gentle rock soundtrack from Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard to round everything off, the production makes for a gentle and pleasant evening, but whether or not it will live on beyond its expiration as strongly as its protagonists is yet to be decided.</p><p><em>Ghost </em>runs at the Festival Theatre until Saturday 2nd March 2019.<br></p>",

The text is grounded and pertinent, and the performances commendable.</p><p>Set over the span of one evening, the story follows Jay, a larger than life American actor (played with almost infuriating energy and lasciviousness by Darrel D’Silva) hired to play a Catholic nationalist in Northern Ireland in a new West End play. His tensions with the work’s feisty playwright, played by Lucianne McEvoy, are central to the conflict of the work. Similar to Ireland’s other renowned work, <em>Cyprus Avenue</em>, it is perhaps questionable that the story revolves around a controversial white man when minority perspectives remain rare on stage. However, <em>Ulster American</em> is without a doubt an interesting commentary on post-MeToo, attitudes and the fakery of such powerful men hiding behind phony liberalism. One particular scene in which Jay and the play’s middle-aged white male director discuss the Bechdel test comes to mind. The two noisily speak over each other, mansplaining the feminist theory; Jay even insists that \"Bechdel was a man\". Each has adopted the lingo of the popular movement without taking its messages to heart, thereby remaining as flawed as their more outwardly sexist predecessors.</p><p>Although Ireland’s narrative at times veers towards the absurd, I found myself baffled at how he managed to capture almost word for word frustrating conversations I have been privy to within the past two weeks. It captures the strange contradictions within a world beginning to recognise longstanding corruption within itself while perpetrators refuse to acknowledge their proximity to the issue. The production is not without its fair share of uncomfortable laughs, some of which a little too uncomfortable for my personal taste, but it remains a relevant and aptly depicted social commentary.</p><p><em>Ulster American</em> runs at the Traverse Theatre until Saturday 2nd March 2019.</p>",

After much debate over their name, a 'sign' allowed the boys to settle with ‘The Four Seasons’. Told through the four perspectives of the band members, their differences are highlighted as each narrative comes with a season (Tommy - Spring, Bobby - Summer, Nick - Fall, and Frankie - Winter). This biographical musical maps their lives, both as individuals and as a quartet navigating the trials and pitfalls of the music industry - from their humble beginnings in The Silhouette Cafe, to the Rock'n'Roll hall of fame. The individual nuances of each character are brilliantly brought to life in a very naturalistic way by - Michael Watson (Frankie), Lewis Griffiths (Nick), Simon Bailey (Tommy) and Declan Egan (Bobby). From the accents to the dancing to the guitars - every detail has been thought through. Special commendation must go to Tara Young playing Mary Delgado, Frankie’s wife and mother of his children, and Joel Elferink who plays camp music producer,Bob Crewe, both bringing a change of pace and comedic flair to the show.</p><p>The stage itself is sparse but effective, utilising a raised walkway accessible by two spiral staircases. Various crucial set pieces are lowered to allow for the quick scene changes that are necessary. The use of colour and lighting is particularly fantastic. The New Jersey silhouette against the backlight sky is particularly effective, especially when paired with the chain link fence. The lighting perfectly complements the mood onstage and adds colour and fun to the raw metal of the set. Whilst some scenes like the ‘December, 1963’ and ‘My Eyes Adored You’ are visually excellent, it seems that more focus was put into some songs and not others.</p><p>The decision to put the drummer onstage is an interesting one. Sitting upstage centre on a platform that moves around the stage, he is at times distracting, pulling the focus from the storyline. This production has very effectively coordinated their musicians into the fabric of the show, having them appear and play onstage in various scenes throughout.</p><p>The costume could be a tricky thing to make exciting in this particular setting, given the majority of choice for the cast consists of 60s suits. However the move from rag-tag New Jersey boys to sell-out musical stars is easily mapped through their increasingly more glam suit jackets: from golf polos to the iconic red jackets to sleek black with glitter adored collars.</p><p>The use of screen projections within the production is good, explaining more of the story through historically appropriate pop art stills; alluding to famous works of the time by the likes of Roy Lichtenstein. The use of ‘videos’ of ‘the four seasons’ and old footage from music audiences is at times a bit jarring to the narrative but nonetheless a fun modern addition on the play, injecting more colour into the set. Similarly a few of the set pieces were standout - namely the recording studio window and the Crewe’s yellow sofa - the less believable being the car and cushioned armchair.</p><p>The performances of the four leads at times could be subdued, but this created a relaxed atmosphere. Toning down the razzle-dazzle often found in musical theatre suited the storyline and audience. An enjoyable experience and worth the watch.</p><p>Jersey Boys runs at the Edinburgh Playhouse until Saturday 2nd March 2019.</p>",

Unfortunately, I’m not convinced this recent stage version, adapted by Antony Lampard and presented by The Classic Thriller Theatre Company, will be receiving any similar accolades.</p><p>The premise is fairly simple: a young woman, Iris Henderson, travelling via train from Vienna back to London befriends an older lady, Miss Froy, who then mysteriously vanishes along the route. Setting out to find her kindly friend, the protagonist discovers that the other passengers deny ever seeing the older woman. Cue accusations of hallucination, Nazi intrigue and an obnoxious English ‘prince charming’ who’ll act as investigating assistant, love interest and all-round condescending nuisance. All the ingredients are there for a gripping WWII-era mystery. The problem with that is expectations fall into one of two categories: atmospheric Agatha Christie-esque twists and turns or jolly comedic espionage romp. However, The Mousetrap this is not. Nor is it The 39 Steps. It was neither as suspenseful as the former, nor as funny as the latter. Rather than a complementary mix of the two, it ended up a half-baked version of neither. Every development felt predictable, every reaction overwrought. The theatrical challenges in adapting a film, a medium which enjoys advantages in omniscience, editing and subtlety, were clearly on display.</p><p>Individual performances were generally good, but actors forced to project and exaggerate dulled the sense of mystery. Progressively, scenes verged on farce as characters were obliged to describe in detail every movement taking place beyond the imaginary train windows, ending in prolonged explanatory dialogue of the ‘now this is happening, now this is happening’ nature. There were many moments of light-hearted, intentional humour sprinkled throughout the play, but I don’t think this was meant to be one of them. The incessant description only served to highlight the lack of imagination on the part of the production team as well as the scriptwriter; theatrical tricks to convey events from afar, such as shadow puppets or projection, were lacking. The result was a strong cast choked by their torturous dialogue, not quite managing to disguise how forced the presentation of nervous energy in a crisis is when you’re rooted to the spot.</p><p>Certainly, moments of greater fluidity stood out, injecting some much-needed dynamism into an oft-flat production. The panic created by Lorna Fitzgerald’s Iris in the closing scene of the first act, for instance, provoked a crescendo of well-choreographed chaos. However, the promise offered to audience members as they attend to their pre-ordered interval drinks of a pacier second act is not fulfilled, and the plodding progress of predictability continues. The swift scene changes do provide the sense of movement you’d expect from a vehicular setting, as do the lighting effects, dancing across the stage; however, such transitions fail to compensate adequately for the laborious dialogue.</p><p>Indubitably, the stand-out performance was Juliet Mills as Miss Froy, who captured perfectly the gentle but crafty English governess, endearing us to her in the relatively short time she features on stage. Indeed, it was a pity she was the one who vanished. It would of course be difficult for the other actors to successfully distract from the gender stereotypes and clichéd British bullishness of a script adapted from a film that is ‘of its time.’ Even so, for a twenty-first century audience it’s hard not to suppress a sharp intake of breath every time the male lead Max  - played by Matt Barber - makes his questionable comments to Iris, such as informing her of how lovely she looks when she smiles. Iris herself, talkative and persistent early in the investigation, fades away when the action proper unfolds, designated to the back of the carriage for the duration of the dénouement or, as I have no doubt Max would have put it had he gotten the chance, ‘the scary bit.’</p><p>The actors cannot be blamed for the script however, and unless the adaptation were to be a complete re-imagination for our times, perhaps frown-inducing moments of patriarchal agony are to be expected. Visually, the set was convincing and practical, capturing the atmosphere of the period whilst enabling the brisk transitions between scenes. The sliding train doors which helped us peer into two sleepers at once were clever; it was just a pity nothing more innovative was designed to minimise the endless descriptions of what was occurring beyond the windows. Nonetheless, in the elegant setting of the Edwardian King’s Theatre the play has found a complementary home in Edinburgh and for a theatrical night-out which is visually pleasing and demands little thinking, with some gentle laughs thrown in for good measure, it’ll certainly do the trick.</p><p>It wasn’t a train wreck but I don’t think I’d bother boarding again.</p><p><em>The Lady Vanishes </em>runs at the King's Theatre until Saturday 23rd February 2019.<br></p>",

One day, a surprise visitor - who finds his employment in helping people - comes along and plants a little seed of hope: the enchanted magic to be found in an old, broken button. As the seed grows, Ted discovers a newfound purpose: cleaning his house and adding a splash of colour to the interior decorations, so that his green-leafed company can grow happily. All seems lost, however when eventually the tree grows too large for the home, and Ted is forced to leave it outside. But that’s the thing with a little gift: its size is not proportional to its wonders. Every day villagers come by to see Ted’s magnificent tree, blossoming high above the terraces – and Ted’s lonely existence is transformed into one of delight.</p><p>The set – the delightfully eclectic and transformative creation of Joss Matzen, John Matzen and Sharon McWilliams – consists of a hillock of old and dusty suitcases; inside which exist the localities of Ted’s journey: a towelled beach, a snowy mountain and a glittering party. There is a thrill to be had in the opening of each suitcase and the reveal of another scene, and the overall effect is both innovative and joyous.</p><p>Guy Hargreaves as the surprise visitor is as skilful as he is endearing. As the sole performer, he is responsible for the dialogue, the masterful puppetry of Ted and making the show comprehensible to its largely younger demographic. Oh – and he plays the ukulele to round it all off.</p><p>He is underscored by Mark Melville’s charming, original composition – which echoes the jubilant and gentle optimism of the events onstage and serves to immerse us in the warm glow of a kind-hearted alternate universe.</p><p>Accessible to all and modest in its excellence, <em>Little Gift</em> is a heart-warming production with a moral of which me might all be reminded.</p><p>Run ended.</p>",

It’s one of the biggest grossing comedies of all time (totalling up to £200 million world-wide) according to the show program; which is why I was so surprised at how disappointing I found this performance. Although the actors - Nigel Haver, Denis Lawson and Stephen Tompkinson - are all titans of the acting world and undeniably talented, the combination of the poor acoustics in the theatre and the outdated presentation of the play resulted in a stifled performance of little emotional investment on the audience’s part.</p><p><br>Reza’s script is fascinating: most impressively, it shone a light on the generational divide. For most of the audience members it was laugh out loud funny. Instead, my peers and I found it thought-provoking, with moments of profound insight within an ultimately sad story. The direction of the play was designed to pull in laughs but it actually felt like Reza’s true talent is in insightful, tragic and dynamic dialogue. For me, the play explores the transition into modernism and the changing world of the 1990s, when postmodernism exposed our constructed identities. Through this play, Reza shows us that our identities are based on our experience of others. ‘I am because you are and you are because I am’ – or something like that. All three men embody an ideology and we watch as these ideologies come to blows.</p><p><br>Nevertheless, the premise is interesting and I genuinely think that, fundamentally, the script is excellent. It just didn’t feel exciting because it came across outdated by thirty years. The black out lighting transitions, the tinkly music and clunky lighting felt awkward. I just don’t think three older white men talking about modern art and their feelings in a convoluted way is subversive or exciting.

With only minimal supplies and each other for support, things were looking up as they reached the summit. The descent, however, proved somewhat of a different story; with harsh weather forcing them into a turn of events that would see Joe slip: the impact of which forcing his knee into his lower shin and puncturing his upper thigh. As Richard assumes full responsibility for Joe, he is confronted with a life-or-death decision after Joe falls over an icy overhang – dangling above the abyss attached only to Simon. So begins the narrative of Simon’s predicament: does he cut the rope holding his companion, or suffer the same – seemingly inevitable – fate himself? As pragmatism conquers over sentiment, Joe falls to what is likely to be his death. Except another strange incident means a ledge breaks his fall; and so begins his solo journey to try and get home.</p><p>Ti Green’s innovation shines through in her design; crafting an icy summit out of a metallic grid scaffold suspended from the rigging, sporadically pasted in shreds of white paper. It provides a curious platform for the actors to navigate; effortlessly tiptoeing across biting topographies high above the stage.</p><p>After the rope has been cut, the story becomes largely individualistic – following the harrowing plight of Joe as he hauls his damaged body across unimaginable terrain. It is a truly gripping story, but one that doesn’t instantly lend itself to the stage. In order to provide some variation, David Greig’s adaptation inserts the hallucinogenic presence of Joe’s sister, who  adopts the role of mountain expert-cum-motivator. Chris Davey’s lighting design begin to reflect the fragmentation of his psyche; becoming more colourful and erratic as the storyline progresses although never manages to sit consistently with the rest of the production. There is a distinct change of tone before and after the severance of the rope – but such a creative decision serves to alienate the second act from the consistency of the narrative, with the effect being an unfortunate lack of coherence.</p><p>Nevertheless, Fiona Hampton is excellent as Joe’s sister, Sarah. She brings a humanity to the role, asking the questions the audience have as to why he would be compelled to try such a feat. Her voice of reason is well-matched by Edward Hayter’s collected yet emotional portrayal of Simon.</p><p><em>Touching the Void</em> is a truly terrifying glimpse into the condition of survival-mode that confronts its audience with a raw and visceral humanity. Though resourceful decisions in its staging occasionally isolate the story from its production, the bare grit of narrative sees for a challenging and suspenseful evening.</p><p><em>Touching the Void </em>runs at the Lyceum Theatre until Saturday 16th February 2019.</p>",

Unfortunately, <em>The Cat in the Hat</em> failed to achieve either. Following the tale of two siblings who are forced to play inside on a horrible and rainy day, Dr. Seuss’ tale is a joyous exploration of the innocent chaos that erupts with the visit of the Cat – a hat-wearing, mess-creating feline visitor – and his two accomplices in crime: the boisterous and uncontrollable Thing 1 and Thing 2.</p><p>Isla Shaw’s set design is instantly striking; taking the form of a large house interior, crafted in the iconic pseudo-illustrative aesthetic of Dr. Seuss’ books. It is a charismatic nod to the marvellous worlds of Seussville, but the harshness of its black and white tonality clash with the otherwise vibrant action of the plot.</p><p>Sally and the Boy - played by Melissa Lowe and Sam Angell, respectively – are endearing, but are deflated by an ill-fitting original score. Though Tasha Taylor Johnson’s songs come with their own merit, they land above the level of a younger audience; with few motifs carrying through to bind the production together.</p><p>Nana Amoo-Gottfried has a difficult job in portraying the Cat – a role hard to separate from personal interpretation and Mike Myers’s extravagant performance in the 2003 film – and manages to make the role his own. However, the slow-paced and erratic dialogue afford him no justice and his vocal style does not conform to that intended by the score.</p><p>The suspenseful arrival of Thing 1 and Thing 2 holds a great deal of potential, but is ultimately unsatisfying as a lacklustre representation of supposed anarchy. Acrobats Celia Francis and Robert Penny are evidently talented - with some of their gravity-defying stunts affording moments of grin-inducing disbelief – but the overdrawn routines in which they run around the stage with their hands in the air make for neither use nor ornament.</p><p>A production where everything works, but nothing quite fits.</p><p><em>Run ended.</em><br></p>",

Memory being the theme to which this story of almost inescapable sadness is centred. It’s also about loss, isolation, powerlessness, connection and the inevitable marching on of time toward the end of the world. The EUTC’s production - directed by Lucy Davidson - does the script justice for the vast majority of its runtime.</p><p><br>The narrative runs through several settings of time and location in England and Australia between 1959 and 2039. These interweave throughout, and in several points the older and younger versions of certain characters perform together on stage in quite beautiful memory sequences - these are points where Davidson’s direction really comes on strong. There is a projection at the back wall signifying which timeline is currently being watched and images showing the setting: a sunset over barren cliffs for the Coorong in South Australia, or rows of grey houses for London. It is effective and the story is conveyed through every aspect of the staging: from the lighting, to the costume and the pipeline installed in the rigging where real (and freezing) rain cascades on to the stage. The music and sound used at specific times also add to a melancholic immersion.</p><p><br>The initial monologue where Gabriel York, played by Barney Rule, in 2039 tells the audience of his life of solitude, and calls the miraculous event – a fish falling from the sky – the best thing that’s ever happened in his life, sets the tone for the bleakness which pervades the narrative. Barney Rule sets the performance bar very high and he delivers this first speech with a tender nervousness showing the affects of years of isolation. The syntax in this monologue is reprised throughout the play and each time the lines are heard again the audience gains new understanding of just how tragic the circumstances are. Praise should be given to the entire ensemble in terms of acting, although at times the Australian accents were slightly shaky. However, the scenes where the most important aspects of the plot are revealed, the most tragic elements take over and the connection between every character is highlighted, all the actors shine. These moments felt like being stabbed in the heart and I can’t deny the tears that were in my eyes.</p><p><br>Overall, the cast and crew created an excellent, memorable and stirring production. All involved should be very proud.</p><p><em>Run ended.</em><br></p>",

Her wince tells me it’s probably vodka. The immediate crowd is pretty similarly aged, with some older folks and post-teen fans mixed in.</p><p>Californian cool-girl Jesse Jo Stark gets the crowd going with up-tempo tunes from her 2018 EP <i>Dandelion</i>, including ‘Breakfast with Lou’. Songs from the next support artist, Hatchie, remind me of the soundtrack to <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i>. Stark and Hatchie both perform in front of a raised curtain, hiding The Vaccines sequinned logo. As the glitters occasionally catch the light, the crowd is reminded of the show to come, and howls for the band to start. The lighting gets warmer, and house plants and fake palm trees are revealed on stage.</p><p>The Vaccines’ wealth of experience, touring with the likes of The Rolling Stones, Arctic Monkeys and Red Hot Chili Peppers, shows. Their energy is infectious, and the crowd jumps with wild abandon as they play hit after hit. All four of their albums feature, as well as their November 2018 release ‘All My Friends Are Falling in Love’ – the song which lead singer Justin Hayward-Young credits for launching the tour. Their impressive setlist is a reminder of their musical journey, one which I shared with them through my teenage years.  Some of my favourites from <i>English Graffiti</i> are overlooked, including ‘Want You So Bad’ and ‘Maybe I Could Hold You’, but it’s understandable why – to play anything slow would quash the energy radiating from the crowd and the band.</p><p>The Vaccines are at home on stage. Justin dad-dances, engaging crowd members in eye contact as he acts out the lyrics. Lead guitar Freddie Cowan reminds me of a teenage heartthrob, pouring all of his energy into smashing through the guitar-heavy setlist. Each song they play transports me back to the time I would listen to it on repeat. As they play ‘I Always Knew’, I’m in the backseat of my family car, driving across Europe. During ‘Wetsuit’, I’m sat in the kitchen of my first-year halls. Live, some of their overlooked tunes are brought to life – ‘No Hope’ belongs on the soundtrack to the Playstation 1 game <i>Tony Hawk Pro Skater</i>.</p><p>Justin mutters his thanks into the microphone – ‘we’ve never met, but you’ve treated us like old friends’. With that, I realise the experience is wrapped in pure nostalgia. In those moments, I’m fourteen years old again, jumping up and down in a disco, surrounded by energetic, sweaty bodies - none more so than the band themselves. Waiting for the taxi home and chatting excitedly in the backseat, I expect to find my Dad behind the steering wheel, eyeing me in the mirror for any trace of tipsiness. I felt a sudden, irrepressible urge to go home, storm up to my room and slam the door, proclaiming ‘it’s not a phase’. Nostalgic, wholesome, and fulfilling in equal measure; like Justin, I was left hoping that ‘everyday could be like today’.</p>",

By logic, Charlie Price is now in charge, but he has just moved to London with his girlfriend in search of a cosmopolitan lifestyle and is hesitant to take the reins from his late father. His worries are exacerbated when a backlog of past orders pushes the factory to the brink of financial collapse, and Charlie is forced to seek an alternative. It seems his answer is found with the beautiful – if not broad-shouldered – Lola, a glamorous drag queen who, along with her equally-talented colleagues, serve as a niche market for male-sized, industrial-strength, sensual heels. Together, Charlie and Lola must put aside their differences in search of a shoe worthy of the infamous Milan catwalk – where not only fashion, but prejudices, are redefined.</p><p>Kayi Ushe gives a show-stopping performance as Lola, serving both looks and heart-melting vocals. He gives life to Jerry Mitchell’s fierce choreography; commanding the attention of both the factory floor and the audience with his troupe of multi-coloured, glittering Angels.</p><p>He is complemented well by Joel Harper-Jackson’s equally-impressive Charlie – an individual whose desire to do please everybody too often clouds his sense of pragmatism.</p><p>Cyndi-Lauper’s award-winning score is as punchy as it is endearing. Pairing ballads with crowd-raising dance numbers, she animates the plot in a way in which the well-known film – the starting point for the musical – cannot; both at once preserving its cinematic charm whilst simultaneously giving it a fresh sense of innovation. Charlie’s love interest and factory worker Nicola – played by Charlie Allen – is able to shine in her humorous rendition of ‘The History of Wrong Guys’; a particularly memorable number through which the rebellious charm for which Lauper is known flourishes.</p><p>A feast for both the eyes and the soul, <em>Kinky Boots</em> will fill your heart with joy and your trousers with fishnets. Grab your heels and put your best foot forward: the party has officially arrived.</p><p>Run ended.<br></p>",

Following a conversation with his put-together friend, John, a Rhinoceros is spotted stampeding through their town causing the locals to react with a mixture of confusion, anger, awe and despair. What begins as an odd and amusing occurrence transforms into a much more sinister phenomenon as the townsfolk themselves begin changing into Rhinoceroses</p><p>Theatre Paradok's presentation of Eugene Ionesco's absurdist play updates the political messages of the original script and setting to the modern day, and it is largely successful in doing so. There are several standout performances; most especially Angus McHarg's portrayal of the central character. As the events of the narrative escalates, he finds his position as an outsider unchanged yet is totally terrified and disgusted by his own humanity at the play's climax. Other praiseworthy performances are given by James Strahan as Duddard - who adopts a constant state of calm and acceptance among the absurdity of the situation  -and Camilla Makhmudi's Daisy who is the romantic focus of both Berenger and Duddard.</p><p>The cast works well as an ensemble, too, particularly during the first Rhinoceros sighting. Katrina Wooley's effective direction comes across here and in the scene changes. From street cafe, to bedroom and office to kitchen table each scene has a particular and realised mood from which the actors can build the tension of the script. The lighting and tech also contribute to this and so the audience is engaged from the outset.</p><p>An interesting addition to Theatre Paradok's production is the use of audience interaction via Facebook Messenger. Audience members receive a barcode, and once scanned they were added to a group chat. This group was sent notifications at various points, mostly during scene transitions. It was fun to see audience members reacting in real time to what was happening on stage and while its hard to say exactly what it added, it certainly did not detract from the experience. All things considered the cast and crew of Rhinoceros created a show with some thoroughly enjoyable moments, strong acting across the board and a highly entertaining evening.</p><p>Run ended.<br></p>",

Due to the nature of his work, McGonagall is often reduced to a historical caricature, but McNair explores his darker context: one of violent humiliation, class struggles and emotional hardship. He is joined on stage by musicians Simon Liddell and Brian James O’Sullivan, who provide both atmospheric accompaniment and moments of humour through carefully interspersed cameo interjections.</p><p>McNair’s hour-long monologue takes a similar to format to McGonagall’s literary style: one that often sacrifices coherency for the sake of rhyme – in whatever format that may be. It is a charming idea, but never manages to quite take flight. The narrative – as charming as it may be – is superficial in its content; deriving most of its humour through hanging rhymes and other literary shortfalls McGonagall uses in his work. It intersects uncomfortably through moments in McGonagall’s career where he is physically assaulted on stage and undermined for the cheap laughs that he is forced to endure in funding his family’s table.</p><p>Nevertheless, <em>McGonagall’s Chronicles</em> takes a unique stance on an otherwise well-known story, and presents events in a more relatable light. A curious presentation; but one whose resonance falters outside of the theatre's confines.</p><p>Run ended.<br></p>",

There is gin in her hand and she has come to her wit’s end. As her worries begin to engulf her, she takes another step towards the rocky edge - but at the last second a young boy pulls her backwards and away from the dangers of gravity. Highlighting the bleak truths of poverty in Edinburgh, <em>Mouthpiece</em> confronts its audience with questions that leave a sour taste long after the final bow.</p><p>So begins the unlikely relationship between Libby and Declan – two members of the same city, whose common ground seems only to extent to the similarity of their home turf. Declan likes to draw, but would never consider himself an artist. Artists are people who can afford to float around and order pretentious coffees and go for brunch. His doodles are just a hobby; and in his stepfather’s eyes a hobby that takes time away from paid employment. Libby, on the other hand, is a writer. But what does that actually mean? And can she still use the title of writer considering the long absence since her last work?</p><p>Kieran Hurley’s masterful script effortlessly captures the essences of two supposedly opposing lives without resorting them to the caricatures of stereotype. In his nuanced exploration of how class and privilege intersect with the lived experience of a shared locality, Hurley asks to what extent the theatre is able to portray another person’s story without talking for them – or worse yet, taking their story away from them. As Libby begins to construct a work that explores poverty in Edinburgh, she takes inspiration from Declan. At first a champion for the marginalised; her script begins to build traction and finances are negotiated. But Libby is making money from Declan’s story while he continues to live it - at what point does inspiration become poverty porn?</p><p>Neve McIntosh is outstanding as Libby – the well-meaning writer whose privilege clouds her ability to write through a reflexive lens and who finds both solace and employment in the young Declan – played endearingly by Lorn Macdonald – a boy whose creativity is limited by the circumstance into which he was born.</p><p>Orla O’Loughlin’s direction is at once powerful and modest – carefully differentiating between the narrative and meta moments in order to confront the audience. Specifically, scenes in which Libby breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience through the framework of traditional literary guidelines serve as a stark reminder in indicating the role writers play in telling stories of which they have no personal experience. Through so clearly indicating that <em>Mouthpiece</em> is a piece of theatre, its plot is transformed from entertainment into reality. What may seem like a night out for the ticketholder does not merely end for its protagonists once the curtain has come down.</p><p>A superb and harrowing diagnosis of society which examines the extent to which circumstance dictates both future and individual agency, <em>Mouthpiece</em> will work to inform, challenge and confront – a real must-see.</p><p><em>Mouthpiece </em>runs at the Traverse Theatre until Saturday 22nd December 2018.</p><p><br>  <br></p>",

Jordan Allen are a neo-folk/pop band from Manchester. Allen's charisma captivates his whole audience, even those whom he acknowledges have never heard his music before. Allen ushers the small audience to move closer in towards the stage, creating a more intimate atmosphere.</p><p>As the band passionately play their set we warm to Allen's distinctive voice and strong accent. Allen is from Bolton and his roots are strongly reflected in both his lyrics and his personality. The amount of energy the band have could have filled a much larger stage than that of Sneaky Pete's, however the grungy vibe of the venue suited them perfectly. Allen is highly interactive with his audience and clearly very keen to make sure the audience have as much energy and enthusiasm as he has. He introduces each song by its name and tells little anecdotes about Bolton nightlife and how their UK tour has gone so far. It is clear as the band continues that they all have a great appreciation for each others musical talents.</p><p>Allen brings a slightly more serious and heartwarming tone to the gig as he introduces the song '110 ways to make things better' which he reveals is about his father passing away due to a brain tumour. Yet this song certainly does not bring the mood down, the atmosphere is very uplifting. As the band begin to play 'White Lines' a tambourine is whipped out and they draw the audience even closer in. Allen jumps off the stage and comes into the audience for his guitar solo which drives the energy levels up even higher. The band introduce their new release 'Naked', encouraging the audience to put it on their Spotify playlists as they want to have more of a Scottish following. Their goal is to fully sell out their gig the next time they return to Scotland.</p><p>The band round off the gig with their hit song 'Rosie' which has the entire audience dancing and clapping in time. They come to a dramatic end with strobe lighting as they give the microphone and tambourine to the audience. Playfully inviting the audience to join them in Newcastle the follows day, they come off the stage and greet the audience and their friends who had been supportively singing along to the side throughout the gig. We hope to see Jordan Allen at an even larger and sold out venue the next time they return to Edinburgh.</p><p>Review by Izzy Parriss</p>",

The pair realise that producing a flop could  - if all goes to plan - generate more money than a success. With the help of the worst director they could find - Roger DeBris - and his acid-tongued assistant Carmen Ghia, the producers set about staging ‘Springtime for Hitler’ on Broadway, feeling secure in the knowledge that it will be a disastrous failure.</p><p>Max McLaughlin’s Bialystock opens the show with a strong, unfaltering performance that carries on throughout. Featuring in and nailing many crucial songs, his talent as a performer is clear. He is perfectly matched by Rob Merriam’s Bloom, a believable comedy wonder whose character brings a laugh a minute and creates a dynamic duo from the get go. Leading lady Georgie Rogers’ vocals soar, captivating the audience as the sought-after-love-interest-slash-swedish-secretary, Ulla. Taliah Horner plays Roger DeBris with flair, injecting showbiz sparkle into the heart of the play.</p><p>There is a lot to be said for the talent within the ensemble too. Under Kirsten Millar’s clever direction and complemented by fun choreography from Kathryn Young, the ensemble really make the musical what it is. Featuring many over-the-top comedic and camp caricatures, tap dancing walking frames and some powerful vocals, the story is skyrocketed to its full potential. The drama that unfolds is further amplified by the accomplished 17-piece pit band, expertly led by musical director Caitlin Morgan.</p><p>The set and tech aspects were striking, brilliantly matching the big city atmosphere; especially the silhouetted skyline of New York against the colour changing backdrop, heightening the different moods in every scene. The attention to detail within the production was excellent, with every prop thought out and every change of costume of high-quality.</p><p>It is clear that a huge effort has gone in from production team and performers and it has most certainly paid off, creating a magnificent piece of student theatre.</p><p>Run ended.<br></p>",

As Fraser puts it: “It’s a bloody steal.” The second thing I learn about them is that they love Scotland, and love Scottish accents. Tom briefly (and rather unsuccessfully) attempts one, before apologising for any offence caused to my people.</p><p>Tin Pigeons are from the countryside, in the East Midlands near Leicester. “You literally couldn’t get any more central.” Morris dancing is big there apparently, but there is not much of a music scene. So they began to play music because they “weren’t good at sport and there wasn’t much else to do.”</p><p>The band don’t tend to write on tour, they wish they did, but because of the amount of travel, they just tend to watch films on the bus instead. Like John Hughes’ 1989 classic <em>Uncle Buck</em>. (We have a brief discussion about John Candy’s premature death. Say what you like about Tin Pigeons, but those boys love a tangent).</p><p>One aspect of touring that they like however, is visiting new places. They visited North Berwick the day before our interview, and loved Bass Rock. “So beautiful, and we never would’ve gone there, if we hadn’t come on tour. Touring is a bit of a holiday like that.”</p><p>When one usually imagines a band on tour, excessive consumption of drugs and/or alcohol might be something that springs to mind. But Tom confesses their only excess is the amount of Chinese food the band has been eating on this tour. “Had one last night, had one this morning.” All-you-can-eat buffets are quite good on a budget, and the boys are adamant that a clear strategy is vital when going in, claiming they have refined maximum buffet consumption in minimal time to a precise art. “You have to be serious. No carbs. We had three platefuls each in 15 minutes last night at China Red.” says Fraser. “Fraser had a pudding as well, he put jelly on a prawn cracker. We got some weird looks” claims Tom. “The staff were chasing us out the door with a broom.” Then Fraser gets a text from TP guitarist Duncan, who is apparently back at China Red for round three as we speak. Fraser speculates that Duncan may shortly have a heart attack. “I feel a bit sick just thinking about that.” Tom admits.</p><p>Back to writing. The band are unsigned, so the business side of things takes up a lot of their time. They feel a bit guilty sometimes because of this, but that’s why they love it when they do get to write. Fraser handles all the lyrics - “He’s always had a way with words, he’s very charming” – whereas Tom does the composition. Whilst they don’t write on the road, the two admit to randomly composing little songs about various objects. Fraser says this is down to spending so much time together that they just develop and share odd idiosyncrasies. There is a brief pause where Tom (who worries he shouldn’t be showing me this) gets up a video of their drummer Rory singing a ditty about Petit Filou yoghurt. Its very silly. “So we do actually write on the road, some absolute bangers mate.”</p><p>I ask what they think makes a good live show. “Energy, definitely. It doesn’t really matter what we sound like, as long as we look like we’re having fun” says Tom. “Its just so much fun. We could be playing to literally nobody, which we have done, and its still the best thing in the world” Fraser continues. “Like in Newcastle, there were maybe only 30 people there, but because everyone was absolutely loving it, it was such a great gig. Even if tonight isn’t crazy busy, if people have given up their evening to buy a ticket to our show, that is f***ing insane! That’s so cool, and whatever level that is, even if its just one person, its worth doing.” They love meeting fans as well. “To be able to speak to someone during tour who isn’t Fraser is honestly such a relief” says Tom.</p><p>Tin Pigeons are often classed as an indie folk band. I wonder what the boys think of this. “I think it’s fair to say that, yeah. Folk in the sense of the raw element to our songs, we’re quite acoustic-y. And also folk in its purest sense is all about storytelling, and our songs always have stories behind them, either about us or people we know” says Fraser. “Or petit filou” interjects Tom. “The bounce is the indie, and the guitar-yness is the folk.”</p><p>Their influences are quite folksy. Bob Dylan and Ben Howard are mentioned, and then we discuss Mumford and Sons. Fraser loves their debut album – “crankingly good” – but denounces their new music as too safe. “<em>Wilder Mind </em>(the third Mumford record) was so good, because they completely broke the mould, from everything everyone thought they were, like foot-stomping banjo solos, and went instead towards a blend of different styles. This new album just feels really safe, just nice pretty songs with simple choruses. Its good, its just got nothing on the last one.”</p><p>I ask what artists they think are pushing boundaries. “Ben Howard” says Fraser. “I honestly think he’s gonna be this generation’s Bowie. His records have all been experimental, and I think he’s gonna keep pushing boundaries and playing with soundscapes.” “I think its really important to push boundaries, otherwise you just go stale” says Tom. “As long as it comes from you, from the heart, then its always gonna be original” says Fraser. “Our latest single, that’s a similar vibe to our older stuff, but also we’ve tried to play around with the production a lot, and go somewhere new with it.” Says Tom.  “If all we ever wrote were the same bouncy summery pop songs, I think we’d get bored. We write music for ourselves.” Says Fraser. I wonder if this is why they remain independent, to keep complete control. “Yeah. There’s a stigma at the moment that to be a successful band, you have to be signed, and have a whole team in place, and that’s bullshit. You don’t need it. It is the hardest graft, but it means we get to sit in a van talking to you in Edinburgh, which is so cool, and really humbling, and there might only be ten people there tonight, but who gives a shit, because we love it.”</p><p>After our interview, Tin Pigeons shake my hand and dart off to China Red, presumably to fill up on as much chow mein and ice cream as possible, before absolutely smashing their gig that night at Henry’s. To attend a Tin Pigeons gig is to witness first-hand not just a brilliant live band, but four individuals who obviously have a genuine love for their songs, and get a life-affirming thrill out of playing them. An inspiring band, and one to definitely keep an eye out for.</p><p>Tin Pigeons’ new single ‘You’re No Fun’ is out now (and it’s a class A banger).</p>",

Worsening every day, Mr. and Mrs. Darling are at their wit’s end. They still have three other children to be strong for, but thankfully their mature daughter Wendy has once again assumed the role of intermittent emotional aide. As tragedy strikes, Tommy’s illness succeeds him and the family are struck by grief. But one night soon after a strange boy named Peter flies through the window and mentions a land where the Lost Boys live. Standing as the only reasonable hope for getting Tommy back, Wendy and her brothers soon agree; and with a little help from a strange fairy called Tink they fly up and away to a new land.</p><p>Ella Hickson’s nuanced script reimagines J.M. Barrie’s original work, placing Wendy very much at the heart of the action. Transforming her from the role of ‘mother’ into a pirate-battling, patriarchy-smashing and all-round powerhouse is a sure reminder of her former marginalization and is as intelligent as it is entertaining.</p><p>Max Johns’ design stylishly integrates building paraphernalia with childhood belongings to create an industrial feel in his far-away worlds. Scaffolding and foam blocks become tree-houses and bubbling oceans, speckled in and amongst balloon rainbows and suspended bathtubs as a grown-up climbing frame. It provides great potential for interesting staging, and Eleanor Rhode’s direction really optimises upon this in the larger swash-buckling battle scenes.</p><p>Unfortunately, where the production excels it is also subject to a sense of incoherency in its creative decisions. Transitions can often be clunky: especially those between Wendy’s bedroom and Neverland – which require a small army of stagehands to re-construct four beds in particularly long black-outs that serve to disrupt any sense of disbelief.</p><p>Nevertheless, Isobel McArthur brings a distinct air of authenticity to Wendy as she undergoes a transformation in herself: from the girl outlawed by make-believe due to her gender into the revolution-leading powerhouse of courage that she has never been able to express. Ziggy Heath’s Peter Pan is charming and playful and brings a sense of poignancy to the darker elements of the play: particularly towards the end of the second act when he takes Wendy up into the stars. Sally Reid plays Tink with as much wit as consideration; as the uncaring (but secretly compassionate) fairy who has Peter’s best wishes at heart to the detriment of anyone who may distract him – most notably Wendy.</p><p>With some charming stagecraft and a whole load of fairy dust, <em>Wendy and Peter Pan</em> is an enchanting production fit for all the family. Carefully breaking the fourth wall to transport younger audiences away as it follows the second star on the right and straight on till morning, it’s going back to the heroic battles of youth… it’s going to Neverland.</p><p><em>Wendy and Peter Pan </em>runs at the Lyceum Theatre until 5th Januray 2019.<br></p>",

As a trained actor, teacher Mr. Maddens seems the obvious choice for director, but a vague and painful memory of receiving minus two stars for his last executive endeavour seems to be hampering his Christmas spirit. And that’s not to mention the smug Mr. Shakespeare from the rival Oakmoor School, whose acclaimed adaptations regularly snag the prestige of the critic’s choice. In an awkward and competitive encounter, Mr. Maddens allows his imagination to get the better of him and suggests a few white lies in opposition to Mr. Shakespeare’s pretentiousness, but the loveable if not bigmouthed classroom assistant Mr. Poppy has heard him out of context... In a whirlwind of events, the council has been notified and press requests are flying in: it seems Hollywood are coming to St. Bernadette’s, and they want to make a feature film.</p><p><em>Nativity! The Musical</em> is positively dripping with joy. Adapted from the smash hit film series by its creator, Debbie Isitt, the production manages both to encapsulate the essence of its inspiration and exceed it – standing proudly in isoltation as a benchmark to which all other festive creations should compare themselves. Utilising both the songs from the film and a new repertoire by Nicky Ager and Debbie Isitt, the show holds something for all the family.</p><p>Simon Lipkin has a high-stakes role as Mr. Poppy, holding a lot of the plot’s progression on his shoulders. He does so with flair and charisma, remaining firmly on the side of the line that reads ‘endearing’ rather than ‘entertaining’ - something that isn’t always easy to do when his personality stems largely from childlike qualities. Scott Garnham’s exasperated Mr. Maddens bounces well off Mr. Poppy’s energy and stands in opposition to the well-meaning but over-excitable headteacher Mrs. Bevan, brought to life so excellently by Jemma Churchill.</p><p>Where the production truly shines is through the children of St. Bernadette’s and Oakmoor School: roles played by a militia of local primary school talent. Their confidence is remarkable, and the quality of their performances could rival many a grown-up. Cracker the Dog completes the theatrical recipe of unadulterated entertainment; and that’s not to mention the costume he dons for his Nativity debut at the end of the second act.</p><p>David Woodhead’s design is truly outstanding; encapsulating the very lifeblood of Christmas in every detail down to the last stitch. Glitter oozes from every star in the set design, and the fantastic imagery St. Bernadette’s teachers dressed as planets really is a sight to behold. A triumph in its execution, <em>Nativity! The Musical</em> is as joyous as it is pure. Bursting from the seams with Christmas cheer: if you hadn’t planned on erecting the tree this weekend, you certainly will be afterwards.</p><p><em>Nativity! The Musical </em>runs at Festival Theatre until Sunday 2nd December 2018.<br></p>",

He is rehearsing for a haunting reimagination of Calderón’s 17th century dramatic text. In a translucent state of affairs, the prince and his saviour appear from the play in blurry fragments within the director’s mind. Through creative abstractions, he develops supernatural powers and is granted blistered glimpses of otherworldly imaginings on the rehearsal room’s walls as he assumes control of his own universe: just as the prince of Calderón’s play takes command through unmediated violence in a parallel sphere of reality. As the piece ventures beyond the confines of the concrete space and away from the privilege of control, the director, too, struggles in tandem with the prince’s fear that the world could evaporate at any moment in fickle conceptualization.</p><p>It is a complicated and mysterious premise, yet serves as an atmospheric context for bold creative decisions within its staging. Kim Brandstrup’s understated choreography is as intelligent as it is unimposing; requiring little to no knowledge of the plot to be appreciated. Set to Lutoslawski’s foredboding composition, dancers drift in and out of the rehearsal room as sinewy ghosts; translucent and ethereal against the shadowy confines of the mottled room. It tells a tale of conflict: an opposition of desires that could well manifest in a variety of interpretations regardless of literary background.</p><p>Design by the Quay Brothers takes the form of mottled projections on the rehearsal room’s walls, providing flickering motifs of other life; dictated neither by reality nor temporality. It is a chilling addition that casts the piece in dreamlike, noir and spectral haze. A partially-disfigured mannequin hovers in a shadowed corner; blurring the audience’s ability to distinguish human from figure; dream from reality. The mirrored floor echoes what penetrates of Jean Kalman’s dappled lighting design; blurring the ambiguous number of students resting against the walls while their director drifts in and out of lucidness.</p><p>However, whilst the production excels through its indulgence of the mysterious, it straddles the line of confusion – oftentimes slipping into the realm of sheer bewilderment. On the one hand, one might assume that a niche understanding of the Spanish Baroque literary canon is the barrier to entry within this context; but Rambert’s interpretation is so far removed from Calderón’s work that it may well be a frame of reference within schemes of wider inspiration. Though individual elements can be appreciated, it becomes a challenge to pair ideas together. An impressive method of storytelling; but perhaps one that relies too heavily on technique than on narrative.</p><p>Run ended.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/m9Oz23ZeYo.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>It’s 1983 – the year that Motown Records celebrates 25 illustrious (but by no means easy-going) years – and the stars have aligned for one final night. Stevie Wonder has donned his finest jacket and Teena Marie has put her feelings behind her in order to honour the man who created it all: Berry Gordy. At first reluctant to attend, the production opens at his home, and in a flashback that takes him back to his childhood the 1938 Joe Louis vs Max Schmeling boxing match, the tale of Motown begins to unfold in a glamorous chronology that commemorates both its highlights and ultimate demise.</p><p>Based upon Berry Gordy’s personal memoirs, the production offers an undoubtedly biased but nonetheless enjoyable version of events. Relying predominantly on its exceptional cast and Motown soundtrack rather than its narrative, <em>Motown the Musical</em> offers a celebratory glimpse into an iconic era rather than an emotional exploration of its agents.</p><p>Karis Anderson is exceptional as Diana Ross, taking command of the stage with a punchy and mesmerizing elegance, with a vocal repertoire to match. She is a natural performer and confidently breaks the fourth wall in her interactive rendition of ‘Reach Out and Touch’ without ruining the flow of the production.</p><p>Whilst evidently complex and technically well-executed, the colourful sliders that work to aide scene changes are jarring against wider scenic design choices – specifically, Daniel Brodie’s modern projection design feels out of place in a musical about the late 20th century. Its caricature depictions of locations such as the Bahamas and the Copacabana Club seem incongruous as backdrops for the live action and true-to-life stories before them, giving the production a distinctly cartoon feel in an era that is anything but.</p><p>Nevertheless, this pseudo-jukebox musical holds as much character as it does energy. With superb choreography by Patricia Wilcox and Warren Adams and an eye-watering number of costume changes to match, <em>Motown the Musical</em> really is the epitome of high-intensity entertainment.</p><p><em>Motown the Musical </em>runs at the Edinburgh Playhouse until Saturday 8th December 2018.</p>",

      "html": "<p>Lizzie Lewis chats to brothers Euan and Callum from Bad Sounds in Glasgow just before they hit the King Tuts stage on their Get Better Clinic Tour, in the wake of the release of their first album.</p><p>Hello Bad Sounds!</p><p><i>Hello!</i></p><p>How’s the tour been going so far?</p><p><i>CALLUM: Really good, apart from Indoor Pets </i>(their support band) <i>got all their stuff stolen, but apart from that its been amazing.</i></p><p><i>EUAN: I think all the gigs so far have sold out on the door, its all been rammed, and sort of better than we hoped for.</i></p><p>In an lot of your interviews, journalists like to draw comparisons between you and other bands, like Beck or Beastie Boys. Do you like being compared to other artists?</p><p><i>CALLUM: Good ones, yeah.</i></p><p><i>EUAN: I don’t mind it, I feel like its pretty stupid to expect people to tell someone about a band without referencing other people, so I kind of just feel like it is what it is.</i></p><p>It seems like your live shows and also your music videos are a big part of what you do. Would you say that image and the visual element of things are very important?</p><p><i>CALLUM:</i> <i>I think its important, and we do spend a lot of time making sure that it comes across in a way that we would find cool if we were fans.</i></p><p>And the live shows, was that always something that was important to you?</p><p><i>CALLUM: Well, when we started out, Euan didn’t wanna play live at all, he hates live shows.</i></p><p><i>EUAN: I never go to live shows. I think theyre really boring, most of the time </i>(I am incredulous at this revelation).<i> Yeah, I just think that most bands just stand there looking moody and playing songs just like the record. I think because I’m so into recording, I just feel like you get the best take you can doing that, so why would you ever go see a band play that song shitter live.</i></p><p><i>CALLUM: (laughs) But please come and see us!</i></p><p><i>EUAN: So when we did it, Cal kind of convinced me that we could do it in a way that was fun and engaging and actually a good experience to go and watch. Cos it is a visual thing, I don’t really get why bands just stand there and play the songs.</i></p><p><i>CALLUM: Depends on the band.</i></p><p><i>EUAN: Yeah its different if youre watching like, virtuoso stuff, I suppose that’s part of it, but as much as I like to tell myself we’re all virtuosos, shredders you know (laughs).</i></p><p><i>CALLUM: But yeah we put so much effort into the live shows because we don’t wanna be boring on stage, we wanna put on a show for people, rather than just stand there and play.</i></p><p>What do you think makes a good gig?</p><p><i>EUAN: I think theres loads of different ways you can make it a good gig, we try and have a more inclusive experience, we want it to feel like a party atmosphere in the room, we always end up getting in the audience. But for me the ultimate is like a Michael Jackson show, with a lot of theatrical stuff as well. Obviously the stages we play don’t really lend themselves to that right now but I would love to get to a point where we could do those types of things.</i></p><p>So that’s your eventual goal?</p><p><i>CALLUM: Well it would be amazing to do something like that, and still have it really inclusive for people, and have them be a part of it.</i></p><p>Do you think its tricky to strike that balance?</p><p><i>CALLUM: I think it really is. At this level its much easier because youre so much closer to the audience, and you feel like youre sharing the whole thing together, rather than just putting on a show for the people in front of you.</i></p><p><i>EUAN: That Coldplay wristbands thing does it pretty well, I think.</i></p><p>So you’ve just done festival season this summer. That always seems to me like its really intense and mad. Is it?</p><p><i>EUAN: Its harder to know what youre gonna get at a festival, because you have no idea if theres gonna be an audience for you. So even though you’re doing one after another all summer, you don’t really get into a routine, cos you have nothing to get used to.</i></p><p>Can that be quite difficult?</p><p><i>CALLUM: It depends on the mindset you go in with. If you expect amazing things and it doesn’t happen then you’ll be really gutted. You just need to go in with an open mind.</i></p><p><i>EUAN: Going in with a mindset of expecting there to be nobody there, is quite a good thing.</i></p><p><i>CALLUM: A natural pessimistic mindset. (laughs).</i></p><p><i>EUAN: But yeah, obviously its wicked playing festivals cos you get to play music to people who haven’t heard your stuff before, and hopefully make some new fans too.</i></p><p>Thank you very much Bad Sounds, been a pleasure!</p><p>Bad Sounds’ debut album <i>Get Better </i>is out now.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bad+sounds&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqk_KLnuPeAhWlLMAKHeTjAYAQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=610#imgrc=SV6lIJldXI4orM:\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/T9YhUwRP0M.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard’s original screenplay for <em>Shakespeare in Love</em>, expertly adapted for the stage by Lee Hall, is as intelligent as is entertaining. Interlaced with nuanced references to Shakespeare’s work, it remains accessible to all – a true achievement in itself. Following Shakespeare as an individual - being the protagonist in his own story - is an interesting and seldom-used angle that personified the myth behind the pages and placed him in a relatable light.</p><p>At the heart of the story lies Will Shakespeare, a hopeless romantic whose writer’s block does not serve well in the number of plays he has been commissioned to write. At a casting call for his latest (and very much incomplete) ‘Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate’s Daughter’, he is presented with Thomas Kent – the male alter ego of Viola de Lesseps, whose dreams of performing on the stage cannot be achieved under the law that prevents all women from doing so. In a wonderfully-intricate and pseudo-Shakespearian turn of events, the duo become enamoured with each other and have to fight for their love in a complicated maze involving nobility, disguise and a distinctly regal dose of wordplay.</p><p>Pierro Niel-Mee’s Shakespeare brings a sincerity that stands well with the determination of Imogen Daine’s Viola; and the central pair are supported by a particularly well-cast company. Rowan Polonski provides expert comedic timing in his portrayal of the supercilious Ned Alleyn – actor extraordinaire and general high-achiever of Shakespeare’s previous productions. It is a testament to Phillip Breen’s holistic direction that every member of the large ensemble is able to come into their own, with each holding standout moments in their respective areas; delicately balancing the production both emotionally and spatially.</p><p>The set – a large, raised timer walkway mounted onto a revolving stage – is an ingenious solution of Max Jones to the wide array of locations within the play. Effortlessly transforming Viola’s bedroom into a theatre stage with one slick rotation, it provides an interesting backdrop for Tina Machugh’s atmospheric and creative lighting design. In particular, the use of candlesticks bathed the stage in a flickering glow, and the well-choreographed extinguishing of their flames serve to highlight the tragedies of a love that could never be – the outermost fragment of a truly wonderful production.</p><p><em>Shakespeare in Love </em>runs at the King's Theatre until Saturday 17th November 2018.<br></p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/xwM0BZ3j17.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>First hosted by Sir Walter Scott in 1822 the Peer’s Ball is an iconic event in history. Celebrating the King’s visit to Scotland and the first time that Scotland’s national dress was worn by the public it was possibly one of the first times Scotland was branded and displayed an identity. Fast forward to 2018 and we have The Alternative Peers Ball hosted by legendary BBC Radio Scotland presenter Vic Galloway. The modern spin on an old event is a showcase of Scottish musical and artistic talent. Having debuted last year with headliners Django Django this year saw Kilmarnock’s own Fatherson take the headline slot. Located in two rooms at the incredible Assembly Rooms on George Street the event included hip-hop, pop, alternative and rock music alongside live art from Too Much Fun Club as well as art from the talented Ursula Cheng. The main room also featured incredible lighting design from Projector Club. These incredible visuals added to the exceptional music throughout the night.</p><p><br>First to hit the stage was Zoe Graham a Glasgow born singer songwriter. Tasked with tackling a big stage without her band she set the night off to a flying start. Using her guitar, keyboard and a looper pedal she created beautifully layered songs that captivated the growing audience. Consisting of songs from her debut EP released earlier this year she displayed her poignant lyricism that is well beyond her years. Zoe returns to Edinburgh on the 17th of November for a slot at Bongo Club. If you like stunningly layered instrumentals and flawless vocals then head along. You won’t regret it.</p><p><br>The first act to hit the second stage was Best Girl Athlete; recently shortlisted for the SAY Award with her self-titled album. Having listened to the record and enjoyed it I was disappointed by her live performance. With little stage presence she attempted to engage the audience with some lack lustre participation. Her single In Your Head did however lift spirits and she was met with applause. Perhaps after such recent acclaim I had expected more from the Aberdeen born singer who I felt gave a quite average performance.</p><p><br>Another SAY Award shortlisted as well as SAMA nominated act hit the mainstage in the form of Kobi Onyame. Representing Scottish hip hop both within the context of the event but also internationally he has grown hugely in reputation with his latest album release ‘Gold’. Born in Ghana, raised in Norwich and London and based in Glasgow Kobi combines influences from Fela Kuti to American boom bap sound to create music that contains incredible beats, catchy hooks with considered and emotional lyricism. Kobi’s performance was one that elevated the atmosphere to party mode. Songs such as Wedadi and Democrazy had the crowd dancing and singing along. With plans to tour the UK extensively next year be sure to catch a live show that guarantees fun, emotion and dancing.</p><p><br>Having released their incredible third album ‘Could it be different?’ earlier this year The Spook School have gone from strength to strength. With two SXSW performances and a KEXP live session under their belt they brought their famous energy to a classy room with not only one but two chandeliers. Their post punk sound that deals with topics such as sexuality and identity is as infectious and the incredible that is their drummer Niall’s performance. Once again a SAY Award shortlisted act the band have established themselves as one of Scotland’s best exports. Memorable moments include their shameless promotion of Linda McCartney’s vegetarian sausages and an unfortunately unsuccessful attempt to get the guys from Projector Club to use the sleep visual of a DVD player as part of their work stating that they want the floating DVD symbol to knock against the walls of the room. A treat for the ears, eyes and funny bone.</p><p><br>Headlining the second stage were the up and coming group Bossy Love. Featured by BBC Introducing they have been busy with recent releases such Whiplash and No Control. Front woman Amandah is undeniably a force to be reckoned with, with her incredibly energetic stage presence and enchanting voice. The electronic beats provided John and others provided a perfect high energy end to the night for Assembly rooms second stage. Destined for big thing expect to be hearing Bossy Love on all major radio stations soon. You heard it here first.</p><p>The penultimate band to grace the main stage were rock band The Xcerts. Having played across the UK and Europe the band are clean rock favourites. I, however, found their performance to be cringe worthy. Punctuated by cliché moments the performance was once again a let-down considering my expectations. Undoubtedly, the band have established a sound and a fan base but I feel they lack any form of innovation and originality. Their performance seems to portray an ego beyond their ability which is disappointing to see. I expect to continue moderately enjoying their studio releases while disliking their stage presence and atmosphere.</p><p><br>Finishing the night off were headliners, Fatherson. Fresh from their sell out show of the Barrowlands the previous night, Alt Peers Ball was the end of their current tour stint. Having released their third album in September the band will be touring extensively in the New Year and most likely continue throughout next summer’s festival season. A band that has gone from strength to strength since their debut album ‘I am an Island’ in 2014 their performance has grown equally in scale. Lead singer, Ross Leighton provides unfaltering vocals while extreme levels of energy are supplied by bassist Marc Strain and drummer Greg Walkinshaw. Their latest album ‘Sum of all your Parts’ has been featured heavily on mainstream radio culminating in a Maida Vale live session with Annie Mac earlier this week. Fatherson are on a trajectory towards massive success and I always expect bigger and better things. A perfect end to an incredible event which I hope returns in years to come. Although not sold out this event is an incredible showcase of home grown talent in an amazing venue. I would recommend anyone interested in good music attends. It not only provides something for everyone but a relaxed atmosphere in incredible surroundings.<br></p>",

Gypsyfingers, founded by Victoria and Luke Oldfield, describe themselves as an alternative folk, rock and pop duo. In the intimately small room, the four piece band set up as audience members trickle in. Before even beginning to perform, lead singer Victoria stands out wearing head to toe sequins, contrasting with the rest of her band who are casually dressed in t-shirts and jeans. As the set begins, Victoria and her husband Luke wear oversized hare and hound masks creating a striking, unique and mystical image; making them look as if they've walked straight out of Narnia.</p><p>Playing songs from their new album '<em>Stranger Things</em>', Victoria's beautiful vocals instantly charm the room. Victoria is clearly a highly talented musician, impressing the audience by switching between singing and playing the keyboard, guitar and French horn. There is a focus on instrumental solos throughout the gig which showcases the talent of all four members of the band. Whilst Luke predominately plays guitar and harmonises with Victoria, he engages the crowds full attention as he sings two songs from the new album in which he solos; '<em>Bruised</em>' and '<em>Blue Sky</em>'. Victoria and Luke's voices compliment each other gorgeously in harmony yet they would benefit from not being drowned out so much by the slightly overpowering drumming.</p><p>As the gig is within its first twenty minutes or so, Victoria and Luke say nothing between their songs creating a distant and slightly moody atmosphere. Yet, as time progresses, they begin to give the audience little anecdotes. As they introduce '<em>The Waves</em>' they tell the crowd how this is their third gig in Edinburgh, Luke reminisces on the 'fond, hazy memories' he has of going to university in the city. The drunken cheers from the neighbouring rooms 21st birthday party is a little distracting, yet Luke laughs it off and the band continue to capture the attention of their audience. Victoria elaborates on the concept of their new album, explaining that it's all about how ''life can be a bit weird''. She also expresses how proud she is of the albums cover art which links to their hare and hound ''alter-ego'' imagery, demonstrated with the masks at the start of the gig. The height of audience interaction is with '<em>Hey Maria</em>', Victoria discloses that Maria is indeed a real friend whom she met at 3am in a taxi, she gets the audience to participate and clap in time which makes everyone smile and sway along.</p><p>The gig is overall very intimate, the musicians despite their otherworldly masks and quirky lyrics are evidently very down to earth, explaining how they mail out all their CD's and LP's themselves. As the show comes to a close, after multiple encores, Gypsyfingers greet the audience members individually before continuing on their UK tour.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/Fh3OVaNAwX.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>On a remote glacier near Reykjavik, filming is taking place for the latest installment of the well-known (but perhaps less well-renowned) sci-fi movie franchise, ‘Vulcan’. <em>Vulcan 7</em> is proud to feature the world-famous - but ultimately washed-out - Hugh Delavois and Gary Savage, but unfortunately a long and complicated relationship of (un)professional rivalry means the duo are less excited for their reunion: perhaps because the last time they were in the public eye together, Savage covered Delavois in custard in front of Alan Bennett. As Eyjafjallajökull begins to emit volcanic tremors and dislodge the icecap, the formidable duo become trapped in Delavois’ personal trailer, and it seems that set runner Leela will have more on her hands than her job description had entailed.</p><p>With a script written by comedic old-timers Adrian Edmondson and Nigel Planer, the premise certainly holds an assumed reputation that precedes it. As the show progressed, however, it became apparent that this potential is to remain unfulfilled. In the programme, Edmondson recalls that he and Planer had been looking to work together for a while, and that this production was borne through the rejection of yet another project that wasn’t ‘quite right’. It is regrettable, then, that what is ‘quite right’ falls on the wrong side of contemporary politics – choosing to mock the #MeToo movement and the radical idea that women in the film industry may exist as more than the sexualized objects of their male counterparts, not to mention the supposedly easy laugh in calling your rival ‘gay’. Though I’m sure the humour was intended to land in a post-ironic sense – to mock the fact that we are even having this conversation in the 21st century – it came across in poor taste and aided to undermine the integrity of the production.</p><p>Lois Chimimba has the difficult task of portraying Leela: a character who is charged with maintaining harmony and an actor who must single-handedly hold the entire production together. Her excellent characterization afforded Edmondson and Planer the wiggle room to wallow in the self-indulgence of their superfluous narrative; providing a large majority of plot points and humorous moments if indeed there were any.</p><p>Her performance is well-complemented by Simon Higlett’s charming set design, which takes the form of Delavois’ personal trailer on the film set. Mounted on some form of invisible, hydraulic piston system, it becomes increasingly tilted with every volcanic tremor and is dislodged to a frighteningly sharp angle – providing a most entertaining curtain call and I’m sure an unenviable number of risk assessments.</p><p>An unsatisfying production, <em>Vulcan 7</em> is obnoxious in its comedic preference and undermined by a dry and inconsequential script: though the film may be futuristic, its stagecraft remains very much rooted in the past.</p><p><em>Vulcan 7 </em>runs at the King's Theatre until Saturday 10th November 2018.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/CM0z9FJaNE.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>As the Darlingside quartet take to a dimly lit stage, the Mash House audience, which has filled the entirety of the concert room, cheer excitedly in anticipation of an atmospheric evening. This atmosphere is immediately created as the Massachusetts-based ensemble collects their instruments and begins to sing. From the very first song of the gig, Auyon, David, Harris, and Don, crowd themselves around a single standing microphone to perform their tightly bound four-part harmonies. This creative decision not only succeeds in blending the group’s voices so effortlessly, but also creates a uniquely intimate performance. The four are intensely united with one another on stage, which translates into the sense of intimacy shared with their audience.</p><p>If for nothing else, it is worth going to see Darlingside for their impeccable musicianship. Each band member changes instrument multiple times throughout the set, most swapping between three during the performance, whilst singing in some capacity on every song. Just when this mastery over multiple instruments becomes normalised, Auyon Mukharji, places his rather large mandolin onto his shoulder, picks up his bow, and proceeds to play the instrument as a violin. Providing no comment for this somewhat strange technique, for the next song he is again strumming it as normal.</p><p>Throughout, there is an enjoyable contrast between slow and fast songs. Just when the band is in danger of sounding too ‘same-y’ with their extensive repertoire of slow, lyrical ballads, they play an upbeat, energetic song, which awakens the audience and gets the crowd moving. Although their performance is entirely simplistic, with little in the way of production, the foursome manage to create a lively and vibrant atmosphere. At points, Auyon plays his instrument in a way one can only describe as ‘shredding the violin’. If it weren’t for their perfectly tuned folky harmonies, one could mistake the stage for some hard-core rock concert, if hard-core rock concerts included delicate violins and folky harmonies.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/tvCMnA5bAV.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The crowd is excitable and loud, frequently shouting and whooping during some of the band’s more up-tempo tunes. Not inclined to remain quiet themselves, there is a fair amount of conversation between the band and the audience. The group tells us about their experience in Scotland, tonight having been their fourth time in Scotland, but their first in Edinburgh. They each take it in turns to tell us something they have learnt during their day in the city, resulting in some crude banter, which is thoroughly appreciated by the, by now, rowdy crowd.</p><p>The band proceed to tell us that they are now going to play an ‘end of the earth’ section, giving us some political context to the songs that follow. There is a clear frustration in the lyrics, a frustration born out of the current political climate of their home country, the USA. For their last few songs, the four band members bring on support act, Hannah Reid, to join them. She plays the violin in accompaniment and is very well received by both the band themselves and the audience.</p><p>It is easy to judge a band on the atmosphere they are able to create and Darlingside clearly demonstrate their skills as beautiful storytellers, capable of creating both a calming and dynamic atmosphere. At the end of their set, the many shouts for an encore are proof enough of the audience’s appreciation, and they will be thoroughly welcomed back to Edinburgh when their next UK tour approaches.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/IDkQ-fT3vj.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The fact that twenty-two year-old singer-songwriter Sam Fender has managed to sell out almost every night of his debut UK headline tour (including three back to back nights at London’s Omeara) is a sure sign that we can expect big things from him, and the crowd at a packed Mash House on Monday 29th October are certainly excited about what he has to offer on the tour’s first night.</p><p><br>Following a fantastic warm up set from A Festival, A Parade, Fender and his band begin their set with his 2017 hit ‘Millennial’, and the opening angry drum beat immediately grabs our attention, forcing us to listen intently to an impassioned ode to growing up the 21st century. After a brief spoken introduction, it is straight back to the music, and one of Fender’s most recent hits ‘Dead Boys’ (recently named Annie Mac’s ‘Hottest Record in the World’) comes early on in the set. Instantly recognisable to the crowd, this track gets one of the biggest reactions of the night, and there is certainly a sense of the magnitude of the issues that the record deals with in his performance, which is again deeply impassioned. It is no wonder that this track has become somewhat of an anthem for the issues that many young men face today, and it is truly one of the high points of the evening. Other highlights include Fender’s latest single ‘That Sound’, with an unconventional but superb acapella start, and ‘Greasy Spoon’, where Fender’s connection to each and every audience member is especially felt. Many of the other songs sung over the course of the evening are relatively unknown to the crowd, but if these are taken from Fender’s upcoming album then we are certainly in for a treat.</p><p><br>Fender only properly chats with the audience on a few occasions, instead choosing to play many of his tracks back to back. Whilst this is fantastic for the momentum of his set, many might argue that the audience could benefit from more inter-song dialogue, particularly because when he does speak, his Geordie-charm makes him genuinely funny and endearing. One moment that stands out is when, during an intimate acoustic song towards the end of the evening, the lights flicker out for a few seconds, or when Fender speaks about his track ‘Play God’, telling us that “one of the best days of my life was when this song got on FIFA…” Whilst Fender is reserved in his dialogue, his attitude to music is the opposite, and it is at the end of the set, when the band leaves the stage and he is left with the piano, that we truly feel the raw power and beauty of his voice. The choice to play ‘Leave Fast’ as his finale is perhaps Fender’s most clever of the evening, leaving the audience chilled into a stunned silence at the sheer beauty of his stripped-back vocal prowess, and in no doubt that he is certainly one to watch.<br></p>",

We knew Jake was a drummer but we thought he was kind of too pro for us, so we asked him if he knew of any drummers and, er, he kind of took offense to that.</p><p><strong>Jake: </strong>I was very upset.</p><p><strong>Lou: </strong>And then he said “yeah I’ll do it” and that’s kind of how it started.</p><p><strong>And you just knew Jake from around?</strong></p><p><strong>Rob: </strong>[Jake] always just used to see me in Weatherspoons, I used to be dead drunk all the time.</p><p><strong>Jake: </strong>He was this guy in like velvet shirts and leather jackets and he used to come over to my table.</p><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Yeah I was that guy unfortunately, through my teens.</p><p><strong>Jake: </strong>Me and Lou actually bonded on twitter. We must have met, I think, at a house party before that and I think I or [Lou] put a tweet up about <em>Caustic Love</em>, the Paulo Nutini album and I was like, my man.</p><p><strong>If you guys hadn’t met and pursued music, what would you be doing?</strong></p><p><strong>Lou: </strong>That is such a hard question.</p><p><strong>Jake: </strong>I’d probably be doing something I enjoy less. I was trying to do session drumming back before, but it wasn’t really fun. So maybe [I’d be] still doing that, [it] depends on how well it went.</p><p><strong>Lou: </strong>It’s been very natural. It’s just kind of fallen into place. I don’t think we ever expected to be touring the UK and gigging like that. It’s crazy.</p><p><strong>Rob: </strong>I don’t think either of us ever expected to be able to tour Europe with a band. That was never in my head at the start. It was just to play a couple gigs and have a laugh.</p><p><strong>Our radio station is based in Edinburgh and we have loads of Scottish listeners. I saw last night you were in Aberdeen, how was that?</strong></p><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Really good. Amazing! It was actually insane. We didn’t really initially expect very much from it because, obviously we’d never been there. And we were sort of wandering around the town before, walked back and there was just this massive queue and I was like, what’s going on? It was just really good, really good vibes in the room. It was very hot, probably the hottest gig we’ve ever played! I got off stage and I was just dripping like I’d just had a bath or something.</p><p><strong>And did you get a chance to look round the city?</strong></p><p><strong>Lou: </strong>Well we had a chance to drive round it, and it’s all very bleak as Jake described it.</p><p><strong>Rob: </strong>It reminded me of Edinburgh in some ways.</p><p><strong>Lou: </strong>Yeah we learnt a lot, learnt all about the oil. I had no clue about that.</p><p><strong>Jake: </strong>How did you hear about that?</p><p><strong>Lou: </strong>Er, I spoke to numerous people about it. It’s very important apparently.</p><p><strong>[The band laugh]</strong></p><p><strong>As you are from Manchester, how do you think growing up there has influenced your sound?</strong></p><p><strong>Lou: </strong>It’s always on the radio. You can’t get away from it. And it is a very unique sound and it kind of just naturally influences you when you’re writing, I guess. But I think we kind of consciously made the decision to try and steer clear of [that sound].</p><p><strong>Rob: </strong>I think as we’ve gone forward though, like actually nowadays, it sort of changes doesn’t it.</p><p><strong>Lou:</strong> Yeah we’ve got stone roses influences.</p><p><strong>Rob: </strong>The Smiths.</p><p><strong>Lou: </strong>We always listen to [them] because they’re so hooky and chorus-y. That’s what you want in your songs, you want people to sing along and they’re just incredible at that. So I guess you listen to quite a lot of it for that kind of thing.</p><p><strong>What are your plans for the future? Is there an album coming?</strong></p><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Something big. We’ve been working pretty hard on something for quite a while. We might drop it soon.</p><p><strong>Finally, who are you all listening to at the moment? Do you have any recommendations for our listeners?</strong></p><p><strong>Jake: </strong>In the van, Anderson Paak is played almost all the time. I’d never really hear him before but he’s sick. Our sound guy just plays him pretty much all the time, and before we go on as well.</p><p><strong>Rob: </strong>I like Club Kuru, I think [they’re] amazing.</p><p><strong>Lou:</strong> Tom Misch</p><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Yeah he’s really cool. We like all chilled out kind of stuff.</p><p><strong>Jake: </strong>I’m pretty much all African stuff at the minute. I’ve got hundreds of playlists of deep African drums.</p><p><strong>Cassia have just finished their headline ‘Loosen up’ European tour. They played their final show in their hometown, Manchester, on the 3rd of November.</strong></p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/iaV3mEoMBD.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>In 1929, Jennie Lee (having just been elected to the House of Commons as a candidate for the Independent Labour Party for North Lanark) became the youngest MP in the country. In the same year, Nye Bevan was elected as the Labour MP for Ebbw Vale – a politician who would go on to oversee the creation of the NHS and act as deputy party leader. <em>Nye &amp; Jennie</em> tracks the often-unheard story of this formidable couple’s story – throughout the course of both their marriage and their political journeys – careers which span the Second World War and the foundation of the Open University, to name but a couple of notable periods.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite the grace of such a powerful subject behind it, the production was ultimately let down by one-dimensional writing that was ill-aided by somewhat obvious creative choices. Meredydd Barker’s script utilizes an overarching emphasis on metaphor and superlative discourse, which seemed rather incongruous against the setting of Nye and Jennie’s private residence. Excessive over-indulgence in linguistic and literary techniques produced a monotonous and stagnant rhythm to the detriment of the overall narrative, which perhaps could have been substituted for the intimate and variant nuances of naturalistic communication. Accelerated progressions in time throughout the play were indicated by awkward periods of era-appropriate music and dance – in which the lacking chemistry between actors Gareth John Bale and Louise Collins (Nye and Jennie, respectively) became ever more apparent.</p><p>In addition, Hristo Takov’s lighting design aimed to reflect the emotional peaks and troughs throughout; suddenly becoming warmer in moments of romance and fading to black in times of hardship. Its lack of subtlety felt out of place amongst the backdrop of wider literary extravagance and sumptuousness elsewhere. However, a saving grace was offered in the final scene – in which the brickwork upstage was illuminated from behind to reveal a series of small incisions in the fabric, causing a myriad of stars to shine through onto the embracing pair - a production full of potential that regrettably fails to propel itself away from the pitfalls of theatrical cliché.</p><p>Run ended.<br></p>",

      "title": "GIRLI at The Mash House",
      "html": "<p>Whilst this is not her first tour, Saturday 20<sup>th</sup> October marks 20-year-old singer, songwriter and rapper GIRLI’s first gig in Edinburgh, and the Mash House with its ace acoustics and intimate vibe seems to be a perfect setting for her debut here. After the crowd are thoroughly warmed up by the fantastic Jerry Williams (who performs a particularly touching track about an alcoholic she met in a bar), GIRLI (real name Milly Toomey) and her accompanist DJ Kitty appear, starting their nearly hour long set with an  unexpected choice of track; ‘Can I Say Baby’, taken off of the artist’s 2017 <i>Hot Mess</i> EP. GIRLI’s trademark youthful energy is clear from the outset, although it takes the also predominantly young crowd until the second song; ‘Play It Cool’ to really begin to loosen up, and it is only here that we can feel the floor of the Mash House start to bounce – a sure sign that something good is happening on the stage. Unusually for a singer, GIRLI seems just as well received whether singing or speaking, and it is her highly politicised inter-song patter that really distinguishes her from other artists, giving an impression that she is well-beyond her years in terms of social awareness. GIRLI’s more playful side is also clear, particularly during one of her unreleased songs ‘Pink’, which the artist tells us is about ‘playing the people that try to play you’. Despite what the song title ‘F**k Right Back Off To LA’ might suggest, the atmosphere in the Mash House is wholly inclusive, with GIRLI telling the audience that she has brought ‘Gender Neutral’ signs to place onto every toilet in the venue; a small but well thought out (and well received) touch. This is not the extent of GIRLI’s connection with the sorts of issues that face young people today, however, as exemplified by her song ‘Up And Down’, before which she tells us about her own struggle with mood swings. Despite this important topic, GIRLI still manages to maintain her immense energy, with a soaring high note in the chorus that is truly spectacular. Other highlights include ‘Young’, GIRLI’s latest single, where she leaves the stage and parties with the audience, truly reflecting that whilst indeed sometimes it ‘hurts to be young’, it can also be the time of your life. The performance is not perfect, but even a few forgotten lyrics cannot dampen the exhilarated mood of the crowd, and GIRLI’s profuse apologies, blaming her first night nerves, only serve to endear us to her even more. It wouldn’t be a GIRLI show without perhaps her most high-octane track ‘Hot Mess’, which she performs last, with a spectacular crowd surfing finale that goes to show that, even though (by her own confession) GIRLI is moving in a more poppy direction, she still retains the youthful ‘rockstar’ persona that her fans know and love.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/h3FmqaSHdr.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/syc7NOOBlG.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Friday night in Glasgow, Mono slowly fills with people as the time for Lucy Dacus’s set approaches. Guitars are tuned and the stage is set up. The tones coming from the instruments are immediately recognizable. The crowd anxiously awaits Lucy Dacus. When she takes the stage she is solo. Beginning with a brand new song, Dacus maintains the light hearted threats from the opening act Fenne Lily to deter the crowd from recording this unheard tune. The crowd is quickly enchanted. Dacus, with her unassuming presence and booming voice, grabs everyone’s attention.</p><p>Immediately after the first song is over, Dacus is joined by a smiley three piece band: guitarist Jacob Blizzard, bassist Dominic Angelella, and drummer Ricardo Lagomasino. Dacus recounts her last show in Glasgow with fondness, and says today has been just as good of a day. Track after track the band goes through <i>Historian, </i>Dacus’s most recent solo album. A few songs in Dacus comments on how it is not her newest album. Getting flushed she can not help but bring up her ‘collective baby’, boygenius’ new self-titled EP. Dacus mentions she did not know if she was going to talk about it at this show, but it seems to explode out of her. Obviously excited and proud, she sweetly smiles and the crowd cheers in response.</p><p>There are only three tracks all night that are not off of <i>Historian</i>, but the crowd keeps up with every song played. There are voices singing along on every track, but the big crowd response comes from ‘Addictions’. Dacus comments multiple times with her appreciation of the crowd’s involvement, stating it makes it more fun for her. There is no doubt that the crowd is invested in every word Dacus’s sings. Some songs are explained, while others are gone into without so much as a breath between songs. The most touching of explanations comes at the beginning of ‘Pilar of Truth’, as Dacus explains that this is a song about her grandmother’s passing. Through all of it, the crowd is engrossed in the show. Most members of the audience have their eyes so intensely locked onto the stage, encapsulated by the magic that seems to be flowing from Dacus herself.</p><p>The show has been beautiful, deeply moving and all engrossing. When it comes to a close, Dacus ends on a performance of ‘Historians’. The Angelella and Lagomasino leave the stage, only Dacus and Blizzard stay for the final song. The guitar is loud and Dacus’s voice is deeply soulful. The song ends, Dacus says her thankyous and promptly leaves the stage. Just like that the show is over. The connection is cut and the crowd is left to emotionally sober up in a suddenly light and bustling room. Stepping out into the cold night after the show is welcomed as a way of waking up from the trance we had all been sung into. After an absolutely incredible and personal show, we are left alone on a cold Friday night in Glasgow.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/XhXpMwhzX2.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><strong>Reviewed by Ethan Rummel.</strong></p><p>I once heard Dracula referred to as 'Bram Stoker’s beaten horse', and the assessment is really quite apt. Since the creation of the famed monster, there have been countless adaptations, portrayals, and amendments made to this cultural icon, many of which are so divergent from the original to as barely resemble it. However, this production of the time-honored classic does much to stay true to its source material, attempting to recapture much of the horror and mystery that had previously escaped due to the cultural ubiquitousness of the subject matter.</p><p>In general, the play is quite successful in its attempts to do so. The set is austere, and though it undergoes many changes of scenery throughout the production, it does much to create a pervasive atmosphere that benefits the horrific subject matter on display. The augmentation of the stage with specialist elements - such as flashing lights and and sound effects - is equally satisfying, and is used with enough reserve to render it truly impactful when it needs to be.</p><p>Likewise, the performances on stage are compelling. The reserved central characters contrast well with the bestial movements of the vampires. Special commendation is due for Cheryl Campbell’s portrayal of Renfield, who’s crazed antics are undoubtedly a highlight. The primary issues with this play come from the source material, and the associated difficult task anyone faces in rendering the classic for a modern audience. The story in the first half, as in the novel, consists of overlapping time lines and locations, that, though cleverly played out, may be found by some viewers as confusing, particularly if they are not familiar with the source material. Similarly, the later half of the play condenses much of Stoker’s work, cutting out many superlative elements, such as explanations of vampire lore, as the production rightly assumes these to be culturally engrained enough so as not to warrant a rehashing for the audience.</p><p>However, some narrative elements during this second act are similarly omitted or glossed over so as to render it a rushed feeling, that, though it corrects the drawn out nature of the novel, may move ahead of some viewers without adequate explanation. Also, as a result of the source material, there persist antiquated themes of female sexual impurity, though these might be forgiven due to their importance to the plot. However, the place where this play most succeeds, is in reviving much of the horror and mystery that has been lost from its titular character. Glen Fox’s turn as Dracula is foreboding, and his bombastic acting, combined well with special effects, makes the vampire terrifying. And for that reason alone, this play is well worth a view, especially in keeping with the spirit of the season - Happy Halloween.</p><p><i>Bram Stoker's Dracula </i>runs at the King's Theatre until Saturday 3rd November 2018.<br></p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/QvlfClUweB.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Gaz Coombes’ provocatively titled third album <em>World’s Greatest Man</em>, inspired by artists such as Frank Ocean to Neu!, instils in me a strange anticipation to experience in the flesh. The crowd seem to share this, as the room grows increasingly warm with every breath of expectation, and there seems to be a lot of expectation. Perhaps best known for fronting britpop trio Supergrass, Gaz Coombes’ solo career seems to be heavily pushed by his musical past, an assumption made by guessing the average age of the crowd to be around 45. Yet, the blue lights flash on and excitement ensues. The small stage is crowded with an array of interesting-looking instruments, leaving a lot for the eyes to unpack. One by one each band member walks on greeted with love from the audience and we begin.</p><p>The first song is the self-titled ‘World’s Strongest Man’, making a poignant statement with lyrics like “I wanna be by myself, don’t leave me by myself”. The irony of the name becomes apparent and suddenly a new layer seems to be revealed to his music, a sense of vulnerability. With each song, this becomes clearer; he talks of his daughter with autism and, as he introduces it, “a song about bad habits”, referring to ‘Sh*t, (I’ve done it again)’. The more human he shows himself to be the more the crowd love him, greeting each finish with verbal embrace. It becomes clear that his music speaks to these people, whether it’s through their nostalgia of the past or the empathy they have for the experiences he sings of; it feels empowering.</p><p>The bass is magnetic, each song boasts powerful riffs and dissonant chords. Coupled with an electric on-stage chemistry between the musicians and a unique use of sampling and looping, the experience is sonically intriguing. But something seems to fall short, in particular, the use of build-ups that never fully pay off. Standing in this muggy underground room, patience is more a virtue than ever. When dissected, each musician seems to play to perfection but the songs drag on and leave the crowd somewhat underwhelmed. It feels more like people are here to see Gaz than fully immerse themselves in the music.</p><p>As we near the end of the set, mild chaos unravels as two members of the crowd collapse, presumably from the heat of the room. Gaz remains calm and sincere in asking if they’re okay, calling for help and passing out water to the crowd. Aside from someone possibly getting hit on the head with a rogue water bottle, the only effect of such disruption seems to be a deeper appreciation for Gaz himself, the crowd cheering as he resumes after making sure all is well. Comically, he takes another hit as the drum machine falters, causing them to restart the song but still, no loss of love. These people seem to truly look up to him.</p><p>With such an impressive voice and solid fanbase, the show was sold out, performing live should be a musical climax. Whilst I left feeling connected to Coombes as a fellow human, I felt his album’s complex themes were slightly undermined by the live performance, as the experimental nature of his songs and long setlist created mild agitation in the crowd when combined with sweaty surroundings and several mishaps. There were, however, insanely powerful parts to his set, and his ability to perform excellently despite slip-ups was extremely admirable. I was also moved by how much his music clearly meant to so many people, and the originality it has maintained after a musical career of over 20 years.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/MTf42BKrrl.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>As the 23-year-old supporting act, Hachiku began her set, she immediately established an intimate yet playful atmosphere for the evening, constructing dreamy bedroom-pop tunes by smoothly layering sounds from a drum pad, electric guitar, synthesiser, and vocals. The SWG3 Studio Warehouse was a fitting venue for the gig, and I was pleasantly surprised by the diverse age range of the crowd, evidence of Snail Mail’s critical acclaim and prominence that has resonated with so many music fans in such a short period of time.</p><p>Despite transforming into a four-piece ensemble for live performances, Snail Mail is the indie rock solo project of Maryland singer-songwriter Lindsay Jordan, who has been described as “the wisest teenage indie rocker we know” by Pitchfork, and a “prodigy” by Billboard.</p><p>Snail Mail captured our attention from the very first second, rolling into a lyricless, sprawling intro flooded with high-pitched squealing guitar effects, which then transitioned into the opening song, Heat Wave. One thing is for certain, Lindsay Jordan oozes authenticity and a sense of sincerity, and her captivating stage presence instantly draws you in, emanating an air of effortless cool. Jordan’s lyrics are hugely emotive and forthright, yet never verge on melodramatic or over sentimental. She invites the listener into the moment with her then swiftly pushes you along before you become too caught up in your feelings.</p><p>Unfortunately, the entirety of the gig was riddled with technical difficulties, and the band struggled profusely to hear themselves through their feedback monitors from start to finish. It was a frustration for everyone in the room, and at times bordered on distracting, as the musicians grew evidently more irritated throughout each song.</p><p>It was during the final three songs though, that Snail Mail proved just how supremely skilled and exceptional Lindsay Jordan and her solo project truly is. Unsurprisingly, when the warm, opening chords of ‘Pristine’ (one of Snail Mail’s most popular tracks) graced our ears, the crowd’s energy level spiked, and a unification between spectator and performer emerged for those precious few minutes. Singing along to every lyric, it felt like this was the crowd’s gesture of gratitude towards Jordan and her band, this being their first ever gig in Glasgow. Halfway through the penultimate song, ‘Deep Sea’, the frontwoman sunk her teeth into a sensational guitar solo, which sent many of us into a frenzy of applause.</p><p>Though the most rewarding moment of the night occurred during the final song, ‘Anytime’, when the band members exited the stage, leaving Lindsay Jordan front and centre, with only her guitar and vocals soaking up every corner of the Warehouse. The crowd fell quiet, absorbing every rising and falling melody and every breath, as the electrifying voice of Lindsay Jordan sent us on our way.</p><p>Snail Mail gave an honest, captivating performance, and their motivation to make the best of trying technical circumstances was a testament to the group’s work ethic and level of professionalism. This is a band with considerable musical maturity and their ‘rough around the edges’ approach to indie rock makes them an extremely exciting prospect. I am very much looking forward to wherever Snail Mail takes us next.</p>",

It is difficult summarise the plot properly, because for a large proportion of the play, nothing quite happens beyond the conversations between Rooster and the visitors that come by him. Having said that, there is no point where there is any space for the audience to be bored — on the contrary, the dialogue is so vivid and quick-witted that watching the play, even in the long stretches where the plot slowed down, was a pleasure. That is an impressive feat, considering the fact that <em>Jerusalem</em> is an absolutely huge work, with a running time of two hours and forty-five minutes.</p><p>A lot of the play’s merit rests on the depiction of Rooster, the central role. He is an unconventional Byronic hero — coarse, crude, yet somehow charming and difficult not to like, despite his status as a drug dealer to local children. Needless to say, this combination must have made for a challenging role, but actor Paddy Echlin rose to it (although his strange gait, whether a limp or a Jack Sparrow imitation, was sometimes a little grating). Not only was little of Rooster’s charm lost, but there was a good transition between the lighter aspects of the character and the more serious, which became apparent with the powerful conclusion of the play.</p><p>Some other notable performances include those by Rufus Love's Ginger, who often made the audience laugh, and Callum Pope's Professor, who, though comically opposite to most other characters on stage, delivered a fascinating monologue towards the end. In general, the acting in the play was decent — where there were areas of weakness, it was made up for by the dynamic nature of the characters and their relationships.</p><p>I also enjoyed the set design by Bryn Jones and Matthew Marsland. Although it was the script rather than the set which explained that the play took place in the woods, there was a sense of the outdoors, and there was an atmosphere perfectly fitting to the play. The set looked so much like where a man like Rooster would live — a battered sofa took centre stage, the broken television at the side, and an array of bottles of varying emptiness scattered throughout.</p><p>But cast and production team alike had the distinct advantage of an absolutely fantastic script. Funny, delightful and simultaneously thought-provoking, <em>Jerusalem</em> is a perceptive update of our views towards nature, Romanticism, and what it means to be English.</p><p><em>Jerusalem </em>runs at Bedlam Theatre until Saturday 27th October 2018.</p>",

As I stumble lost through Glasgow I am very conscious of the fact that the 8:30 start of IDLES set is quickly approaching. When I near Queen Margaret Union its not google maps that lead me to the venue, it’s the booming sound of IDLES’ opening song that is filling campus. I ran towards it like a moth to a lamp.</p><p>At the end of the first song the gig is on fire. It doesn’t feel like the start; the crowd of mostly twenty to fifty year old men is hype and singing along already. I get stuck in the back. I can’t see the stage but the crowd is pulsing.</p><p>IDLES tear through tracks. With the end of one quickly comes the start of the next. No one misses a beat. Everywhere people are embracing, singing to each other, jumping, dancing, crowd surfing.</p><p>With the scream “I am a feminist!”, IDLES launches into ‘Mother’. Social and political commentary come between many tracks along with thank you’s to the crowd and the security guards catching the onslaught of crowd surfers. The political messages fuel the crowd, the energy of a like-minded group fed with the frustrations of the world.</p><p>The crowd leaps as ‘Danny Nedelko’ and ‘Divide &amp; Conquer’ come up in the set list. Announcing “without you we are f**king nothing”, the band pulls members of the crowd onto the stage. Only insanity ensues. Singer Joe Talbot pushes off hangers on, but accepts what appears to be a very heartfelt fan hug. When it’s time to get the fans off stage the task is not easy, but eventually everyone trickles off and the gig jumps straight back in.</p><p>Claiming encores are for idiots, IDLES announce their last song. Talbot does his part, says thanks and leaves the stage. The rest of the band carries on with face melting musical mayhem. Guitarist Mark Bowen brandishes the mic but only for screaming into. Full of noise and energy, suddenly the music cuts, the lights go out, and the band leaves the stage.</p><p>As promised there was no encore. This show was one of the best shows I have seen in years. Every single person left drenched in sweat and with a smile on their face.</p><p>I am a massive fan of classic 1970’s punk. That causes me to be a skeptic about almost all new bands that label themselves as punk. I put them under a microscope and compare them to the likes of the Modern Lovers and the Clash. Few, if any, have filled the requirements that I believe it takes to be a true punk band. IDLES is one of the few. This show felt like the closest thing I’d ever get to being in a 70’s punk venue.</p>",

Whilst separated by time and space, the three by-lines are interwoven through universal themes of wartime horror, and question whether or not someone ever truly can return from a conflict zone.</p><p>Technically, Andrzej Goulding’s production design is exceptional. Located in and around a rotating shipping container, projection and carefully-planned adjustments to the container’s walls locate the piece smoothly and dynamically through different spheres of spatiality. In addition, sound design by Pete Malkin and lighting design by Zoe Spurr work harmoniously - both to aid the narrative and to disorientate the audience at times of intentional confusion.</p><p>While Anna Jordan’s script is intelligent in its triadic presentation, it relies heavily on the use of stereotype in its characterisation. As a result, characters are one-dimensional and lack a human familiarity from which the largely emotional narrative would have benefitted. For example, the present-day soldier is shunned by his community for his ill-justified violence towards Afghan citizens on duty, and a reporter casually suggests that perhaps the hostility towards him had in fact been facilitated by the Islamic Centre. It is a fleeting yet unhelpful comment that serves to exemplify a lack of nuance in the wider plot and in the current political context of wartime rhetoric.</p><p>Where the production excels, however, is in the well-conceived blend of theatrical techniques for which Frantic Assembly is best known. A particularly memorable scene saw the horrors of shell-shock and the onset post-traumatic stress disorder manifest themselves within Great War veteran George, portrayed sensitively by Jared Garfield. In true Frantic Assembly style, the wider ensemble of three further actors utilised physicality and a vivid use of wider stimuli to represent his suffering, with its non-verbal and interpretative nature affording the audience to formulate their own sense of his suffering individually, drawing on their own framework of toxic emotions.</p><p><em>The Unreturning</em> explores the human elements of war; developing three cross-sections of varying experiences and formulating them through an emotive lens. Though aided by clever use of technology, the overarching narrative is undone by under-developed and stereotyped representations - a powerful statement about humanitarian tensions that remains unsatisfying in its execution.</p><p><em>The Unreturning </em>runs at the Traverse Theatre until Saturday 27th October 2018.<br></p>",

Navigating the tricky waters of family tensions, pregnancy and the breadline is no easy task, but Tony discovers the possibility of independence through the prize money of an upcoming dance competition, and sets about trying to make his dream a reality.</p><p>Holding so much of the plot on his back individually, Richard Winsor has a daunting challenge in playing Tony Manero. With an impressive background in dance he excels throughout the musical numbers, but in trying to embody the iconic charisma of John Travolta he is never able to truly come into his own and make his mark on Manero’s characterisation – instead, he is forced to confine his physicality into an awkward recreation of caricature. Consequentially, many of the more emotional by-lines are muted through frictions of this conflict of representation.</p><p>Set to the music of the Bee Gees – brilliant portrayed by Edward Handoll, Alastair Hill and Matt Faull on a raised gangway upstage – the production holds a certain charm but is ultimately deflated by clunky direction. An unnecessary number of scene changes frequently plunge the stage into blackout, which halt any flow before it has a chance to get started. There are also inconsistencies within the pacing of the script – a number of the more serious plot threads are denied the stage-time needed to be resolved coherently – in particular, the suicide of Tony Manero’s friend, Bobbie C, and its aftermath seemed trivial; given no more than a passing glance before the glitzy finale.</p><p>Nevertheless, a general sense of coherence is stitched throughout the production by Bill Deamer’s large, flashy choreography of the larger dance routines. Combined with an excess of glitter balls, his era-appropriate routines showcase the evident talent of the ensemble, and serves as welcome highlights to an otherwise ill-conceived narrative. Aided by the fame of the Bee Gee’s score, <em>Saturday Night Fever</em> is accessible to younger generations who may not have the seen the film, and consequentially is able to stand in its own terms as a theatrical piece rather than a live representation of cult cinematography. An enjoyable performance - You Should be Dancing in no time.</p><p><em>Saturday Night Fever</em> runs at the Edinburgh Playhouse until Saturday 27th October 2018.<br></p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/0gV-gd0N6x.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><strong>Reviewed by Timna Abramov.</strong></p><p>A critical aspect of Rufus Norris’ production of Macbeth is stated clearly in the programme: Norris aimed to captivate younger audiences, particularly those studying the play, however Norris’ production was flawed. As is so often the case in Shakespeare productions, the speech often felt as though it was being read out across the stage, with little sense of a relationship either between characters or between words. This aspect was particularly disappointing, especially when considering Norris’ desire to spark interest in younger audiences — how can students of Macbeth be expected to engage if they can’t follow the reasoning and conflict within each character? To me, this was a significant area of weakness.</p><p>Yet many aspects of the production were good. Despite the lack of fluidity, some performances stood out. Lady Macbeth’s role was done justice, especially in her last speech; Rachel Sanders’ Ross was a pleasure to watch. The contrast between Macbeth’s gruff exterior and his vulnerability was effectively expressed in his  soliloquies, and across the entire cast there were specific lines which were powerfully delivered.</p><p>Visually, the production was promising; the setting was well-captured by the military costume design the set, which was dark and grimy, reminiscent of an army bunker. Norris opted for a post-apocalyptic setting, which suited the starkness of the play, and also served to highlight the relevance of Macbeth to the modern world. The setting enhanced the plot by its attention to camaraderie, which served to make the regicide more unsettling, a difficult aspect to capture in a world that no longer depends on stable monarchy. However, it also created an undertone of excessive masculinity, which both complimented the primitive violence of Macbeth and was an effective addition to Shakespeare’s examination of gender.</p><p>What I was most looking forward to, though, was the atmosphere. On a windy autumn night in Scotland, watching a production of Macbeth seemed perfectly fitting. And initially, the atmosphere Norris created suited the play; the three witches, pale against the dark backdrop, brought a haunting quality to the stage with a classically horror film aesthetic (I was reminded of Robert Eggers’ The Witch, in terms of visuals and audio). But as the play progressed, the mood was lost, and the genre seemed to flicker — what had at first been supernatural became almost like a drama. There was an attempt to restore the eeriness at the end, but by then the tension was lost and the damage was done, and the result was an ending that was neither powerful nor pathetic. In a sense, the great frustration with this play is not that it was bad, but that it wasn’t incredible, which perhaps it could have been.</p><p>But did Norris manage to engage his audience, as intended? Overall, yes. While the execution of the production did not do it justice, suffering from a lack of consistency and natural flow, the play was neither stiff nor excessively academic. Norris’ production was stimulating, fresh, and entertaining — worth the watch.</p><p><em>National Theatre's Macbeth</em> runs at the Festival Theatre until Saturday 27th October 2018.</p>",

The audience are allowed to hear these songs, so familiar to them but only on the terms that they are to be cut before anyone gets too comfortable. Its purpose is to say, yes you may have seen and heard some of this before, as the play deals with the hardly untrodden story of a girl who’s been recently sectioned, but we are assured not to be stilled just quite yet.</p><p><br>Set in a Psychiatric Ward in Lewishman, Michael Hajiantonis’ <em>Going Slightly Mad</em> follows the story of mad Max, played with a feral ferocity by Lizzie Lewis, as she comes to terms with her surroundings and the people that inhabit it. First up there’s cynical Anna and the harmless, lovable Joey, played off against one another brilliantly by Tilly Botsford and Charlie O’Brien. Later on we meet local boy Leon (Levi Mattey) and the mute Irish James (Amelia Watson).</p><p><br>The play works at its best when all the actors are on stage, which you find happens a lot with the directors Michael Hajiantonis and Sophie Smith truly make the most of their talented cast. No one is underexploited, with each character, bar Max, finding themselves in no less than three other roles. <br>The script is sharp and very funny, after all depression doesn’t have to be depressing - and considering the strangeness and chaos of the situation, you’d have to be mad not to find some humour in it.</p><p><br>The play only suffers when it struggles to maintain the momentum into the second half, which the writer and directors attempt to resolve through a bizarre and unnecessary fourth-wall breaking scene. Leon confronts the audience to address what we’ve all been thinking: ‘why am I being forced to sit in this <em>People, Places and Things</em>-cum-<em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</em> student knockoff?’ However, I doubt many people had been thinking this. Yes, the psychedelic dance scenes have been done before but that’s because they have a close bearing on reality. Ultimately it only really served to give the impression of the writer defensively trying to shut down criticism before it could even be formulated.</p><p><br>The play should trust itself more as it has more than enough to stand on its own, because rarely - if ever - do you see a script capable of addressing and compounding pre-conceptions around mental health whilst simultaneously discussing the wasted comedic potential of <em>A Question of Sport</em>’s Phil Tufnell.</p><p>Run ended.<br></p>",

Bourne is, at his heart a storyteller; who builds upon traditional choreography with embellishments of contemporary, characterful movement. Removing ballet from its stereotype as a form available only within the remit of the well-afforded upper classes, Bourne opens up the discipline to wider society and ensures there is something for all.</p><p>At the core of this world-renowned adaptation is the creation of an all-male swan ensemble – a decision that subverts the traditionally heteronormative encounter between the Prince and the Swan into a same-sex liaison; in whatever semblance personal interpretation may permit. Underscoring the entire production with a muscular elegance, this creative decision remains to this day as iconic as it has ever been. Making an unforgettable entrance at the lakeside - where the Prince had gone at his wits end with the intent to end his suffering - the bevy of swans storm the stage from all angles, dominating the land with their threatening aggression and untamable beauty.</p><p>Lez Bretherston’s design beautifully accompanies the production, helping to whisk the audience away into far and distant lands without being gimmicky. In particular, the final image of his eerily distorted bedroom provides the sterile backdrop for a heartbreakingly visceral tableau of lost love.</p><p>A celebration of ballet past and future, <em>Matthew Bourne’s Swan Lake</em> is magnificent. Sewing together the highlights of classical choreography without the pretense, Bourne inserts his own playful twists that work in contrast to the darker core themes within – a staple piece in the world of modern dance.<br></p><p><em>Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake </em>runs at the Festival Theatre until Saturday 20th October 2018.</p>",

On a Wednesday evening, 10th October, entering Glasgow’s The Garage, the crowd doesn’t seem phased by this departure; the show was even sold out. There is excitement laced between the nightclub/venue as murmurs are heard throughout the crowd about the night ahead.</p><p>The Story So Far takes the stage at 8pm exactly. The melodic twang of guitars introduces the first couple songs of ‘Nerve and ‘Proper Dose’’: and in the first four bars of the song a mosh pit develops.  A collective cheer after this high-energy opening almost drowns out frontman Cannon’s thanking of everyone to be here. The audience mouths move, demonstrating the hours devoted to memorisation. A chant begins  (“The Story So Far”) after; the audience asserts themselves as a collective community.</p><p>‘Things I can’t change’, from their second album, begins giving off an anthem-like quality. It overshadows the last two songs; the building’s voices almost drown the microphoned Cannon, who punches the air, leading them on. The two guitarists keeping to the edge of the stage as ‘All wrong’, ‘The Glass’, ‘Let it go’, ‘Heavy Gloom’, ‘Keep this up’ continue the show. Cannon thanks the crowd with genuity again. ‘Singing now feels good’, ‘Drink safe, Drink safe’ are other small positivities are said in between the songs.</p><p>Proper Dose’s leading single ‘Upside Down’ - is partly overshadowed by the roaring of ‘Roam’ playing directly after.The entire room jumps in time and with the audience involvement with overpowering lyrical tones and two mosh-pits seeming to be opening up; the resonance of their older songs are evident.</p><p>With a glance, the crowd who seems to largely be in their mid-20s suggests these could be loyal fans from when The Story So Far’s original albums came out in 2011-12. Perhaps then linking it with the common belief of Pop Punk being branded as “dead” in 2018. The days of My Chemical Romance and Green Day are over, and perhaps the fans are only there for the older pop punk.</p><p>Yet, the chant for an encore after the final bars of “Quicksand” is deafening. And as The Story so Far’s most successful song ‘clairvoyant’’s tuneful acoustic guitar plays, the room changes tone; under the white stage lights couples embrace each other, phones are out filming and members of the crowd climb onto others shoulders. The chorus’s mantra of “Don’t paint me black when I used to be golden” ends the set with the same vitality that started it: yet this time on a softer note. The cheers after the show ending go on for long after the band exits.</p><p>Yes, the eldest songs proved the most lively. But, the concert never dipped further than this. In recent years the pop-punk scene has not hold as much prevalence as it once did, but this show seemed pretty alive. Cannon’s leadership of the show paid off with intense audience immersion proved a special dedication of both audience and band for an experience. Perhaps loyal fans overshadow the loss of a scene.</p>",

She has a wedding to attend, and it will be a welcome opportunity to leave the stress of her newfound motherhood behind. Except her mother Margaret wasn’t born yesterday and locks them both in the bathroom until the ferry leaves – it seems ‘wedding’ is a strange term for political activism in the Arctic that serves to destroy oil rigs in its waters, and Margaret does not approve.</p><p>Inspired by the 2013 arrests of 30 Greenpeace activists who boarded an Arctic oil rig in protest, Clare Duffy’s nuanced script elegantly explores the conflict between ethical and pragmatic duties. Ella wants to change the world so that her son can grow up in a better place, but Margaret is more concerned that Ella remains a part of it.</p><p>An unflinching look at family dynamic, Duffy’s script excels in understanding the human psyche. Presenting a rich and multithreaded private background, Jennifer Black’s Margaret and her calm façade work well in contrast with the genuine desperation of Neshla Caplan’s Ella. Gareth Nicholls’ direction places a well-placed focus on maintaining familial normality in an otherwise unconventional situation, and moments of tension are emphasised by a careful framework of peaks and troughs throughout – even if some of the friction did originate from a somewhat incongruous subplot involving the father of Ella’s baby and a sabotaged mission.</p><p>A well-grounded and thought-provoking piece, <em>Arctic Oil</em> captures the essence of familial frictions within the structure of wider duties. Questioning whether or not the price of saving the world outweighs that of leaving it, this succinct production is highly commendable in its efforts.</p><p><em>Arctic Oil </em>runs at the Traverse Theatre until Saturday 20th October 2018.      <br></p>",

Performing the band’s best-loved hits, this theatre-cum-gig takes the audience back to where it all began and re-lives the best memories.</p><p>The first half commemorates some of The Beatles’ most iconic performances – opening with the 1973 Royal Variety Performance where John Lennon famously told the rich amongst the audience to ‘shake their jewelry’ - and glides between glorious, equally standout moments (stopping, of course, at the magnificent and ever-radiant Lonely Hearts Club). After the interval, the Beatles join together one final time for the reunion to end all reunions, and play a host of their best-loved hits – including from solo ventures which emerged post-breakup.</p><p>So-termed a ‘jukebox musical’, the performers allow the music to speak for itself – interrupted only by interim audience interaction as they transition between instruments and epochs. A multitude of equally stunning lighting compositions by Sooner Routhier and Robert Long bathed the stage in a sumptuous and atmospheric glow, gloriously erupting in the woozy mellow of Strawberry Fields Forever. Michael Gagliano, in particular, was exceptional as John Lennon, capturing his rebellious nature through every wig change and period of self-growth.</p><p>The tremendous musical ability of all involved was apparent throughout, but the overall production was woven together a little disjointedly. Four cumbersome TV screens around the stage served to provide footage period-appropriate footage – both of The Beatles’ performances and of adverts of the time. It was a nice idea but the sparkling gleam of 21st century technology clashed somewhat with the nostalgic and vintage illusion produced on stage. Perhaps a filter added to the live footage of the night would have helped to maintain the impression that this is a pseudo-theatrical performance instead of a tribute band. Furthermore, I felt that the booming voice of the compere before and after the show cheapened what those on stage had worked so hard to produce.</p><p>Nevertheless, Let It Be is a triumphant celebration of an iconic band. With such an extensive repertoire of timeless classics on which to rely, the production can afford to let the music speak for itself. Excelling in their performances, the cast of <em>Let It Be</em> takes you back to where it all began, and riotously lead us through the defining moments of a still-reigning history.</p><p><em>Let It Be </em>runs at the Edinburgh Playhouse until Saturday 13th October 2018.<br></p>",

After an altercation at Grand Central Station, they are bundled up onto a cargo ship and sent far away before a certain group of mischievous penguins take command of the vessel and end up accidentally depositing the motley crew in Madagascar, where all manner of new experiences are to be found.<br> <br>Admittedly, the show took a while to find its feet (with the escapees not arriving in Madagascar until after the interval), but the second act more than made up for it with an abundance of joyous ensemble numbers and a hilarious appearance from King Julien (the reigning ring-tailed lemur, side-splittingly portrayed by Jo Parsons). Matt Terry’s understated honey vocals led the show with a quiet and charming confidence, and he was the icing on the cake of a particularly well-cast company.<br> <br>Unfortunately, the score itself was largely forgettable, with a few recurring motifs carrying the brunt of the entire musical. It was somewhat disappointing, but the familiarity afforded to it by the film worked to conceal such a creative oversight, and I dare say it would not have fared so well if it did not have the association of its older sibling. Nevertheless, it was clear that those on stage were having a good time, and as a result there was a large grin on my face throughout.  <br> <br>Visually, the production is a colourful feast for the eyes, and Max Humphries’ puppet design is exceptional. With such a wide range of animals involved, it was impressive how seamlessly the cast transformed into different characters and how effortless they brought the puppets to life. Capturing the essence of the film animation with its stylised aesthetic, both set and costume complement each other in achieving a cartooned effect. <br> <br>An entertaining evening, <em>Madagascar the Musical</em> is an on-stage party. Though it may be jagged in execution, it overflows with energy: ticking all the boxes for a younger audience.  <br> <br><em>Madagascar the Musical</em> runs at the Edinburgh Playhouse until Saturday 6th October 2018.</p>",

Fear not though! Help is at hand! A new project introduced here in Edinburgh is attempting to use music to help get people grooving and raise money to support the Scottish Association for Mental Health.</p><p>The new event promoter EML (Edinburgh Music Lovers) is launching itself through a series of upcoming live music events across the city in the upcoming weeks and months. In an attempt to tap into the wealth of artistic diversity and talent here in Edinburgh the company is planning on staging concerts, festivals and live music nights to really showcase the cities musicians. Starting next week (on the 29th September) with a live performance from Colin Stetson, an experimental musician who has ditched life stateside for a wee trip to Scotland, EML are not wasting time in rolling out a programme of events that are bound to appeal to all kinds of music lovers. From East London rappers like Kojey Radical to more local acts, the company’s mission is to bring music back to the city. Profits from these events and those that follow are being invested in the charity SAMH (Scottish Association for Mental Health) as the director, and former DJ, Jim Byers notes the ability of music to heal. He uses his own experiences, opening up about past challenges in his life and how music helped him work through them Writing on the company website, Byers says ‘ from my dad’s suicide when I was 10 to my own struggles with depression… Music has always helped me and I’m hoping it can help others.’ EML’s mission is not only exciting but admirable and no mean feat!</p><p>With his past years of experience in the music and PR world, Byers looks like the perfect candidate for this huge undertaking and with a city full of funky artists, groovy grandmas and sensational students there’s no better place for doing it! Already with a name for itself as an arty hub, Edinburgh’s fringe festival attracts thousands of locals and tourists every year, but what EML will hopefully fill is the gap in the music market. It is not for a lack of talent in the city that Edinburgh is yet to have a festival but restrictions over the years on noise, construction and crowd control has resulted in the stagnation of musical events here in the city. Equally these issues have contributed to the closing down of many iconic city venues, making it even harder to keep the music scene alive and fresh. However, all is not lost! Edinburgh still has a reputation with established club nights and venues like The Mash House, Liquid Rooms and The Usher Hall all offering some great nights. Add to this the revival of other locations such as Leith Theatre, Rose Street Theatre and Old Dr Bells Baths it seems the trend for growth is positive.</p><p>Indeed there are positive signs for EML everywhere you look with the City Council aiming to work in close collaboration with the company in order to push their projects forward. There has also been backing from legends such as Pete Irvine (the organiser of Edinburgh’s Hogmanay as well as other events) and Dougal Perman of The Scottish Music Industry Association; all of which is helping to boost the company’s reputation already.</p><p>It is not just those in the Music Industry that have come out in support for Byers’ project, mental health organisations in the country too have shown their backing for the idea. Fiona Lewis, the Corporate Partnerships manager of SAMH has declared her appreciation of the efforts of EML stating ‘Thank you to Edinburgh Music Lovers for standing with SAMH... we are proud to be working closely with [them] and the music industry in raising awareness in mental health.’ In an era where these issues are really coming to the fore of the public conscious, it is great to feel that projects like EML’s are now trying to really facilitate solutions and help the millions of people out there to get back into the groove.</p><p>So to the music lovers, secret singstars and terrible dancers of Edinburgh- keep an eye out for EML coming to venues near you soon!!</p>",

A venue renowned for polished, international theatre, I was intrigued to see how the shows at Summerhall compared to other (often more small-scale and budget) Fringe shows, as well as to each other.</b></p><p><b>SKaGeN/KVS’ Unsung explores the psyche of homo politicus, with Valentijn Dhaenen’s portrayal of the politician during a tumultuous election cycle. Despite being the sole actor, Dhaenen’s performance fills the stage. Convincing and believable, he adopts the role of homo politicus with startling resemblance. His carefully constructed speeches and body language remind audience members of current prominent politicians, including Donald Trump. Many scenes were particularly profound; following a leak of explicit images exposing the protagonist’s affair, Dhaenen uses his massive, ‘perfect’ election image as a physical barrier between himself and the photos, which are being shot at the audience with an air blower. Perhaps the politician uses his perfect image as a defence in itself, or as something to hide behind. Though meaningless political rhetoric if frequently used to indirectly say something meaningful, stark diction also undercuts the script; one line in particular, “people want things to change, they don’t want to change”. Equally, emotional moments pepper the script, reminding the audience that despite his façade and scandal, homo politicus is still a human.</b></p><p><b>A walk over to New Town took me to Army @ The Fringe for Komuna//Warszawa’s Cezary Goes To War. Four actors and one pianist conduct aerobic military recruitment exercises, live soundtracked by a variety of Polish folk and classical pieces. Yes, it is as surreal and obscure as it sounds. The team behind the show received the Best Artistic Team Award at the 2017 Divine Comedy Festival (Krakow), and their musical talents carry the show through absurdity. Half of the time, the audience were laughing as a result of the actors’ facial expressions and dancing. The other half seemed to come from giggling. A real contrast in style and content to Unsung, using physical movement and humour to approach a serious topic.</b></p><p><b>Summerhall’s Demonstration Room provided the perfect venue for Elbow Room’s Prehistoric, a bolshy and roaring image of the punk music scene in Brisbane, Australia in 1979. The energetic four-strong cast explore themes of civil liberties and resistance in the context of the ‘punk moment’ under the Queensland’s brutal Bjelke-Petersen government and policing. Prehistoric received the Best Performance Award at the Melbourne Fringe Festival; the emphasis on performance must not be understated. Deb, Nick, Pete and Rachel’s journey from meeting to forming a band is brought to life by live music and songs interspersed throughout the play. Hilarious and unapologetic, Prehistoric caught and held my attention from start to finish.</b></p><p><b>The dark and cavernous basement of Summerhall is an ideal location for immersive theatre, and Knaïve Theatre’s War With The Newts. This reimagined production of Karel Capek’s dystopian science-fiction satire was engaging from the outset. As the audience walked into the venue, we were congratulated on ‘making it aboard’, checked for illnesses and allocated a job (stamped on the arm) based on which colour we identified our mood with at the time. As a green, I was allocated ‘oddjobs’, and sneered upon when shown to my seat inside. In my view, War With The Newts is a case of dystopian drama at its best; captivating and immersive from beginning to end. The cast of three flawlessly transitioned between different characters to tell the apocalyptic tale, making great use of physical and digital props to present and crack a façade of calmness in a storm of trouble.</b></p><p><b>In Two Destination Language’s Fallen Fruit, writer and performer Katherina Radeva explores her experiences of growing up in communist Bulgaria, and the collapse of communism. The play is full of intricately woven stories and details, including that of a (necessarily) secret lesbian relationship, and the effect of 1989 upon the individual lives of these women. Radeva is energetic and fun on stage, playing up to the image of a young pioneer in the youth wing of the communist party whose uniform she dons. Indeed, this is no mean feat for an 11am show at the end of its full Fringe run. Though at times disjointed, the various storylines are interesting and charming.</b></p><p><b>Finally, Raw Material’s After The Cuts is a satirical piece which considers a NHS-less future, in which ordinary citizens are forced into expensive private healthcare or, in the case of Jim and Agnes, more rudimentary DIY options. The cast of two shared fantastic chemistry together, and were singularly bold and hilarious. Despite the fact that Jim narrates the play, at times the audience wonders whether there is a protagonist at all, with Agnes’ scathing sarcasm providing the perfect counterbalance. Without wanting to spoil the play entirely, Jim labels himself a ‘fixer’, and decides to take matters into his own hands when Agnes falls ill. In this vision of the not-so-distant (or different) future, After The Cuts calls upon past notions of ‘make do and mend’ in times of hardship. The play balances comedic and thought-provoking scenes perfectly, with direct reference to our present; Agnes concludes that we (the people) let ‘them’ privatise the NHS, and didn’t put up enough of a fight. As with Prehistoric, After The Cuts was staged in Summerhall’s Demonstration Room. The inclusive nature of the venue worked equally well as a living room (and makeshift operating theatre) as a stage for live punk music.</b></p><p><b>Unfortunately, I was not able to see LUNG Theatre’s Trojan Horse, which received great critical acclaim for its exploration of Muslim extremism in Birmingham schools. Nevertheless, I can certainly say that my desire to see political theatre was well and truly fulfilled, with the plays above considering political themes in the past, present and future. The quality and variety of shows presented at Summerhall’s venues this Fringe did not disappoint, with something for everyone’s interests.</b></p><p><em><b>Jelena Sofronijevic for Fresh Fringe.</b></em></p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/u-PEadVBI4.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>In his brand-new show \"50\", Ben Hanlin bravely attempts an incredible feat; fifty magic tricks in fifty minutes. While the show in fact ran over by about ten minutes, somewhat defeating the purpose of it, I still found it to be an entertaining and thrilling ride. As you can imagine, the show is incredibly fast paced and keeps your eyes fixed to the stage, out of fear that you may miss a single moment of a trick. Hanlin also includes an education in magic tricks and he shows off just how much of a self-proclaimed 'magic nerd' he truly is. For example, he describes different experiences he has had watching other magicians as he grew up, and guides the audience into feeling that same love of magic. He describes how he felt seeing a particular trick and then proceeds to do that same magic trick himself. I was hesitant that I may start to feel his show and tricks to be unoriginal, but Hanlin weaves the old, familiar tricks with his own, new inventions.</p><p>Despite it being a completely new show, that even Hanlin admits at times is unpolished, I found \"50\" to be crafted incredibly well. While the show did run over to about an hour, it is still an amazing achievement. Hanlin has clearly worked incredibly hard to find the right tone for this show. He is sometimes wonderfully funny, and other times very serious, the perfect combination to keep the audience entertained. Most of all, Hanlin is friendly and approachable, which is everything you need an entertainer to be. He is kind to the audience, which makes them want to actively participate, rather than begrudgingly be selected for a trick. Hanlin does not presume the audience should be just as fascinated by magic as he is, yet appears to wish that they leave with an excited and uplifting feeling. I can say for sure that I felt this way for hours after the show ended.</p><p>There are indeed kinks that need working out; timings could be sharper, the tricks easier to see and even a couple felt a tad too easy to predict. However, if you are looking for an energetic, bemusing and fun show that does not take itself too seriously, Ben Hanlin’s \"50\" is certainly the place.</p><p>Ben Hanlin’s \"50\" is on every day at The Pleasance Dome at 7pm.</p><p><em>Verity Sawyer for Fresh Fringe.</em></p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/JRf4Sac0HJ.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>A quirky play that comes all the way from London's indie theatre scene, It's Not Cute Anymore, is a hilarious caricature of the millennial generation. Knight and Hoey play two eccentric junior editorial assistants, who prance around the stage as if the world revolves around them. Both girls are very dissatisfied with their day jobs and dream of grandeur and fame. However, their frantic scramble to stardom isn't as nearly as glamorous as the girls like to portray on their Snapchat accounts. The real picture involves deceit, desperation and downright stupidity.</p><p>Hoey plays the brash, selfish and vulgar 'Mimi'; a comical combination of character defects that leave the audience in stitches. Hoey's exaggerated facial expressions bring the narcissistic nature of Mimi to life, as we witness the character in some very sticky situations. Knight plays 'Elle', a peculiar girl who  pushes her unrealistic hopes and dreams on Mimi; very narrowly destroying both their careers in the process. Yet despite the shallowness of both characters, they are still likeable. They are so pathetic that you almost wanted them to succeed.</p><p>Both actresses skilfully embody other characters in the play, with Knight shining as kooky Aunt Bronwyn; the fading actress, who may or may not have fabricated every detail of her career.  The vulgar jokes that are woven throughout the script work well, and the comic timing of both actresses is impeccable. Knight and Hoey are certainly ones to watch.</p><p>'It's Not Cute Anymore is a hilarious twist on the ambitious millennial narrative that despite the over-the-top characters and storyline, remains somewhat relatable to those struggling to get their foot on the career ladder.</p><p>You can catch 'It's Not Cute Anymore' every day at 1.20pm in Underbelly's Dehli Belly until 27th August.</p><p><em>Frankie Elyse for Fresh Fringe</em></p>",

Then I saw his show. The whole thing really is magical.</p><p>Armed with a variety of diverse and fresh material, Eli really makes his Fringe debut known. His dazzling charm and charisma lights up the intimate venue as he tells the audience of his personal journey of sex and dating. No details are left out, as his risky and daring anecdotes leaves little to be imagined. Not afraid to laugh at himself, the comic adopts a self-mocking humour that make him more personable and relatable. In particular; there was a certain comparison to Lee Harvey Oswald which had me on the floor.</p><p>The show itself has an impressive amount of fluidity. Eli naturally flows from one idea to another, causing the hour-long show to appear to fly by.

Comedian and actress, Lolly Jones, launches into her sensual satire, where she dons the roles of Theresa May, Margret Thatcher, Angela Eagle, Arlene Foster and Nicola Sturgeon.</p><p>What makes Jones’ act so special is her impeccable mimicking of the doomed politicians’ voices. As recordings play on a continual soundtrack, Jones contorts her face and body into each woman. This brings to life the self-serving and meaningless rhetoric of politicians and is a springboard for some superb, if simplistic, dance routines.</p><p>The real comedy comes from actual recordings of Theresa May. Jones makes her audience hyper aware of the absurdity of May’s comments through her voluptuous act. The infamous ‘running through fields of wheat’ is given new pizazz with sexy dancers shaking wheat. Similarly, May’s 'girls night in' PR disaster on International Women’s Day becomes a whole sequence of daring dressing gown dances.</p><p>Jones makes May do a painful post-election boogie to Sia’s song, Chandelier, and then imagines the first meeting of May and her husband. In a perfect sequence they met at the Cambridge University Conservative Society disco. As Theresa and Philip dance to The Piña Colada Song, Jones brings miraculous humanity to May’s un-relatable sound bites.</p><p>But the comedy does not stop at May. Jones runs us through the last few years of female political history. A highlight is Thatcher possessing a traumatised Theresa.</p><p>As Jones changes costumes, Liam Hourican treats the audience to a video cameo as Jacob Rees Mogg. He adds edge to an already superb show, giving Mogg the evil twist needed to propel Jones’ characters further into the patriarchal political sphere.</p><p>Although hilarity ensues, Jones is making a serious comment about the incessant questions our female politicians face. May is demeaned by her contemporaries and the press, as she is constantly compared to Thatcher and asked about her shoes. Jones’ act highlights female politicians unique struggle across the political spectrum.</p><p>While most of the comedy in \"Fifty Shades of May\" comes from real sound bites, Jones’ act makes a powerful statement about how we treat our female politicians. Catch her show for fifty shades of sensual, sexy satire. This is niche burlesque at its best, with more to offer than on brand nipple tassels.</p><p><em>Jane Prinsley for Fresh Fringe</em></p>",

The Chooky Boys (the 4 dancers that make up <i>Djuki Mala</i>) then come on to stage, performing a traditional Aboriginal dance, set to indigenous music</p><p>Suddenly, though, the troupe breaks out into contemporary dance, with booming disco music and bright lights. The tone of the rest of the show is set: gone are the traditional Yolngu dances and music, replaced instead with a range of modern routines and costumes, from a Gene Kelly-esque number, to Motown boogies and a Michael Jackson-inspired tribute.</p><p>However, that’s not to say that, after the first dance, the Yolngu spirit is completely lost from the show: quite the opposite. Between each number, videos of the boys and their Elder discussing the troupe’s beginnings and their Yolngu culture play, teaching us about their childhoods and history. Perhaps the best thing about each of the dances, too, is that no matter what their style, there’s still a thread of Aboriginal character running through each. Whether it’s an odd Yolngu-like dance move thrown in here, or a variation of a well-known step there, the Chooky Boys manage to make each routine feel like their own.</p><p>This being said, there is one point where this enriching fusion of cultures feels slightly inappropriate. In one dance, the Chooky Boys don gold turbans and perform a Bollywood style number, which, given the mostly Western audience and lack of Indian performers, did strike a bit of an uncomfortable chord for me.</p><p>The rest of the routines, though, were an absolute joy to watch, and that is no doubt largely down to the Chooky Boys’ dancing skills. They bring a fizzing energy to the stage that never drops throughout the show and, despite their range of choreography, manage to take on each different dance with aplomb. Their movements are sharp and in-sync, and the range of different styles and multiple costume changes means the audience’s attention never wavers.</p><p>The personality of the <em>Djuki Mala</em> performers also shines through in every number. Whether it be an odd wink at the audience or the pulling of a funny face, there’s a cheekiness to each of the boys that brings a warmth and relaxed nature to their performance. The audience is left in no doubt when the Elder on the video mentions the comedy that occurs at Yolngu boys’ initiation ceremonies.</p><p>In a festival dominated by Western theatre and theatre-goers, <i>Djuki Mala </i>brings an important and refreshing cultural spectacle. Its fusion of Western and Yolngu culture seems to reflect the development of Aboriginal culture in Australia today, while the characters of the performers and their fun choreography make it a joy of a show to watch.</p><p><em>Francesca Sellors for Fresh Fringe</em></p>",

Using a mixture of puns, one-liners and a surprising amount of educational narrative, Eshaan hilariously talks us through the basic teachings of the Qur'an.</p><p>As the audience settles into their seats, an amusing edit of the famous, \"Drop It Like It's Hot\" blasts through the speakers. Eshaan Akbar then sways and sashays onto the stage, informing us that whilst he does not plan on getting targeted during one of his performances, it certainly would be one hell of a way to go. This risky humour sets the hysterically tongue-in-cheek tone of the rest of the hour. Filled with satirical and pop culture references, the show does not disappoint as Eshaan provides a little something for everyone. The comedian allows us to see the funny side of religion, as he picks apart many aspects of Islam, whilst also clearing up any misconceptions the audience may currently hold.</p><p>Due to the show's highly informative and interesting nature, there are times when a joke appears to fall flat as the audience have been too engrossed in learning about Islam. However, like a true professional, Eshaan never lets this get in his way as he expertly pokes fun at himself and ends up leaving the audience in stitches. A naturally funny man, Eshaan commands the stage with such a grace that it's hard to believe that he only took up comedy seriously a mere four years ago. \"Prophet Like It's Hot\" is slick, entertaining, and downright hilarious. Eshaan definitely made the right decision by quitting his day job as a banker to go into comedy.</p><p>You can catch \"Prophet Like It's Hot\" every day (except 15th) at the G<em>ilded Balloon Teviot.</em></p><p><i>Frankie Elyse for Fresh Fringe</i></p>",

      "html": "<p>Towards the end of \"Terry Alderton: The Musical\", Alderton says to the audience that he can’t wait to imagine you describing this show to your friends and family, and in this line, he has pretty much summed up the entire show. For his show is a crazy, mind-boggling mess that had me wondering as I left, whether I loved it or hated it; whether he was a buffoon or a genius. Even as I write this review, I still haven’t quite made up my mind and doubt I ever will.</p><p>This show is a mix between stand-up and musical comedy, paired with flashing lights, screeching noises and overhead voices that are used to express Alderton's \"inner thoughts\". At least, this is what I <i>thought</i> the overhead voice seemed to represent, especially after Alderton sang a song about being \"Bipolar Guy\". Alderton seems to be telling a story of someone going increasingly insane, but it is difficult to be certain because he often quickly switches to appearing just like any other comedian doing a stand-up set in a far saner manner. I will say is that this has to be the most bizarre show that you will ever see. If you like taking risks, this show feels like the equivalent of going bungee jumping for the first time – it’s exciting, and even if you hate it, it was a one in a lifetime experience.</p><p>At times, Alderton spoke so speedily, using his strange voices (something he is well-known for), that I struggled to understand him. This felt like an intentional decision on Alderton’s part to express Alderton’s increasing appearance of madness, or even to confuse the audience into a nervous laughter. Even if it was intentional to mispronounce his words, I personally found it to be a little uncomfortable and would have preferred to be able to simply enjoy his funny voices <i>and </i>know what he was saying.</p><p>One thing Alderton does very well is surprise you. Nothing he does is ever predictable, to the point where I had my jaw open throughout the entire show, simply wondering what he would do next. He shows no shame over the incoherence of his show, and is proud of what he has created, which I think he should be. To be able to stand out from the immense crowd of performers in the fringe and say that your show is the most unique, despite its flaws, is impressive.</p><p><em>Verity Sayer for Fresh Fringe</em></p>",

      "title": "Glenn Mooreâ€™s \"Glenn Glenn Glenn, How Do You Like It, How Do You Like It\"",
      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/jFMbPvhrxP.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>At 6pm on a Wednesday night, I found myself winding down the stairs to the basement of The Tron, eager to watch Glenn Moore’s comedy sketch \"Glenn Glenn Glenn, How Do You Like It, How Do You Like It\". To be standing in a small basement room in front of a packed audience, is a world away from his usual set up at Mock the Week, Stand Up Central and Absolute Radio. Yet, he has never appeared more at home. Aged 29, his sketch centres around his dating errors, housemate woes, career aspirations and more. From embarrassing sex-stories, hilarious anecdotes of his middle-class upbringing, and his quest to appear more attractive, Moore’s sketch is a roller-coaster narrative, bouncing from one topic to the next with ease. The storyline is fluid and well linked, interjected with brilliant one-liners whilst the narrative approach allowed for a well-rounded performance, keeping the audience engaged and interested throughout.</p><p>It was Moore’s self-deprecating one liners which make the show, being his greatest comedic attribute in my eyes. His self-deprecating approach not only created an unquestionable rapport with the audience, enhanced by the small and intimate venue, but made him and his stories all the more relatable. They are punchy and well executed, if not a little too fast-paced at times, sprinkled throughout the narrative without being too overpowering. Moore, unlike many comedians these days, does not try to be controversial or outspoken to garner laughs, but instead pokes-fun at himself, explaining, for example, how he wouldn’t survive in prison with his \"cherubic features\", creating a comfortable and jolly audience atmosphere.</p><p>Only being his seventh show of the month, I will not be surprised to see this garner lots of attention. If you want to be kept laughing throughout, enjoy a pub-comedy style venue, and love a narrative-style comedy, then look no further.</p><p>Moore’s show is on every night (except the 13th) at 18:20pm at Just The Tonic- The Tron.</p><p><em>Susannah Blenkharn for Fresh Fringe</em></p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/hB9-nKEWaA.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>With discussions about mental health and LGBT rights becoming increasingly mainstream in within comedy and the arts, Catherine Bohart is here to talk about both. Catherine is bisexual and has OCD, two things that she has needed to prove are ‘real’ to her Catholic Irish parents. She compares this to her parents' faith in God with incredible wit. She speaks of coming out to her parents with silly and joyous storytelling. Whilst I wasn't falling to the ground laughing, her story was compelling and funny.</p><p>Catherine clearly has an amazing story to tell, and while it is certainly engaging, it does not always have the biggest punchlines. Yet whilst I did not roar with laughter, I did laugh plenty, and had so much fun hearing Catherine’s stories. She is the definition of bubbly, and makes you feel extremely comfortable in her presence. Even when asking the audience awkward questions such as, \"Is anyone here bisexual?\", she does so with grace. She finds joy in any response you give; a joy that transcends into the audience and makes you instantaneously like her.</p><p>Catherine speaks of her family with fondness and an understanding of their flaws. She is never mean-spirited in her jokes and seems only to wish to tell her story with grace and light humour. However, whilst I did enjoy hearing about Catherine’s father becoming a deacon, and her frank admission of being hospitalised for four months with OCD, the way that she frames her jokes and punchlines could be better crafted for a bigger laugh. Yet perhaps it is not intended to be a show that leaves the audience incapacitated by laughter; perhaps it is simply meant to be a comfortable way of talking about some uncomfortable issues. Nevertheless, I found this an amusing and educational hour which leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy afterwards. So despite a few flaws in joke telling, Catherine is a delightful story teller and her show is certainly worth a go if you are stuck on what to see in the afternoon.</p><p>You can catch Catherine Bohart's \"Immaculate\" every day (except 14th) at 16:15 in Bunker Two in the Pleasance Courtyard.</p><p><em>Verity Sayer for Fresh Fringe</em></p>",

      "title": "Citadel Festival at Gunnersbury Park, London",
      "html": "<p>In its fourth year, Citadel transforms Gunnersbury Park into a feel-good haven of music and art. Expect long hair, glitter beards and a LOT of good music.</p><p>Festivalgoers are immediately met with mass yoga practice, croquet and volleyball games in full-swing, next to a flurry of rides and food stalls -  most notably a chicken stand which could be mistaken as a mini stage, due to the large crowd attracted to its DnB blaring from the speakers. Each attraction and stage encapsulate their own aura. Attendees can intently listen to the low-key, acoustic sounds of Sofar Sound’s hand-picked artists (a worldwide collective where you apply for tickets to watchemerging artists perform in a secret location – click here for the Edinburgh site: <a href=\"https://www.sofarsounds.com/edinburgh\">https://www.sofarsounds.com/edinburgh</a> ) in a bohemian tepee with plush cushions, without being distracted by your typical <i>disco night at Mash House</i> playlists of Diana Ross and CHIC coming from the Chapel of Love – a small tent hosting an array of glitter clad disco dancers.</p><p>The Kopparberg DIY stage is the most charming location on the grounds: a small enclosed stage resembling a boxpark, hosting the likes of the Liverpudlian duo Her's charming the crowd with languid hits like ‘Cool With You’, and finishing the day with the unmistakeably cool rock-tones of Pumarosa<i>. </i>The warm vibe of the festival is made clear across the stages, as anthemic favourites like Honne’s 'Warm on a Cold Night'<i> </i>and Dermot Kennedy's raspy passion ring out of the various tents throughout the day.</p><p>As the day goes on, an eclectic mix of stellar artists grace the main stage. As the crowd sits, waiting in anticipation for sultry rockers The Horrors<i> </i>to arrive on the main stage, I speak to two members of the crowd, Ned and Ben, asking them about who they’re excited to see. “Well, I mean, we saw Tame Impala on the line-up and immediately bought tickets,” Ned says. I ask them if they’re excited for The Horrors<i> </i>to come on, to which they respond with a confused “who?”.</p><p>The crowd continues to grow, watching the wonderful chaos of South London’s Fat White Family<i>, </i>culminating in their performance of 'Whitest Boy on the Beach'<i>, </i>to the electronic, pixie-like tones of CHVRCHES. Unmistakeably, the key attraction of the day is the hugely coveted headline performance of Tame Impala: a UK exclusive for 2018 after their three-year hiatus, following the 2015 release of their album <i>Currents. </i>As the group runs through hits 'Let it Happen' and 'Elephant'<i>,</i> alongside constant confetti canons, the excitement only grows, culminating in the crowd favourite 'The Less I Know the Better'. What’s so spectacular about the scene is the use of neon graphics on screen, blurring out the visuals of the band. This means that the crowd gradually gives up trying to film the set, and whilst their Instagram stories may suffer, the audience is fully immersed in the layered tones of the psychedelic songs.</p><p>Citadel is particularly strong in its recruitment of soul and jazz acts this year. The highlights are clear: the jazz-funk group R+R=NOW,<i> </i>who’s set could be understood as an ongoing jam session filled with brass and synth solos; hip-hop/jazz duo Blue Lab Beats<i> </i>whose music resembles a fusion of J. Dilla and John Coltrane; and the subtle tones of legendary jazz-guitarist Kamaal Edwards<i> </i>bring the day to a smooth close. However, the undoubtable star of the day is American born singer Leon Bridges. Defying the critique that his nostalgic style too closely reflects the likes of Sam Cooke amongst other 60s soul singers, Bridges enchants the audience with his slow-dance 'Beyond'<i> </i>and upbeat political statement song 'Bad, Bad News'.</p><p>In regards to its female line-up, Citadel has also done particularly well in distancing itself from recent London music festivals. Wireless made the news for having only an astounding three women on its main bill last weekend, whilst Lovebox wasn’t particularly successful either. Whilst there’s still a way to go, Citadel put itself on the map with Victoria Park’s new inhabitants, the female-forward All Points East, hosting acts like the rock-band GOAT, DJ Nabihah Iqbal's disco-infused set, and French Indie Band, La Femme.</p><p>If you’re looking for a festival where you can enjoy a range of your favourite artists whilst discovering new ones AND you can go home to your own bed at the end of the day (bar the transport <b>MAYHEM </b>on the way home: <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/citadel-festival-complaints-festivalgoers-huge-queues-london-gunnersbury-park-acton-town-2354907\">https://www.nme.com/news/music/citadel-festival-complaints-festivalgoers-huge-queues-london-gunnersbury-park-acton-town-2354907</a> ), Citadel 2019 is the one to watch.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/Mp8foubLmJ.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>A word of advice - as the heatwave continues alongside festival season, please remember: Britain you are not immune to the sun and bum-bag tans aren’t cute.</p><p>Link to Citadel's website here: http://citadelfestival.com/</p>",

Why did you decide to create Date Night?</strong></p><p>I created Date Night because I wanted to encapsulate those first pangs of romance, and the playlists and mixtapes you make. A kind of soundtrack to those first butterflies.</p><p><strong>What is the meaning behind the name?</strong></p><p>I like the idea of people being drawn to one another at my night. It felt appropriate.</p><p><strong>Do you have resident DJs, or do you like to introduce/rotate new talent?</strong></p><p>I mostly stick to the people I trust and with those I've worked with before, or have come recommend. But for bigger events, I like to bring in others.</p><p><strong>What kind of style does your DJ bring to the table?</strong></p><p>I'm a stickler for a DJ that plays the classics, maybe more the obscure.  It ultimately love what DJ Kiki does for Drugstore Glamour. The atmosphere she creates is incredible.</p><p><strong>What kind of genres does Date Night play around with?</strong></p><p>Alot of synth, classic indie, Italian disco, 80s freestyle...but I never plan the night. The crowd dictates the course of the night!</p><p><strong>Do you have a philosophy towards the parties you throw and the atmosphere you create?</strong></p><p>Get 'em sweatin', get 'em winchin'.</p><p><strong>Which venues do you tend/prefer to play in?</strong></p><p>Sleazys is an institution and they took a chance on me, and let me host two clubnights with them. I've played The Duck, Stereo, Broadcast, most of Edinburgh's venues too. I loved playing at the Old Fire Station for an after party for Talbot Rice Gallery. I do love playing in spaces that aren't traditionally venues.</p><p>When Mash House was transitioning into Mash House, I used to play there. It's worked hard and invested in awesome promoters, and it's soaring. I originally wanted to take Date Night there, but was loyal to Sleazys when they sacked a clubnight to make way for mine. But I love what Mash House do, and have been lucky enough to work with Paradigm and Main Ingredient. I prefer venues that get the aesthetics and installations of Date Night. I'd love to do something at Summerhall someday.</p><p><strong>What hopes do you have for the future of Date Night?</strong></p><p>It's still a low-key night.  I may disappear and only emerge every six months to throw a party in an abandoned train tunnel.</p><p><strong>When is the next time we can go out for a Date Night?</strong></p><p>Date Night is at Nice n Sleazy this Friday (22/06). When it returns to Edinburgh it'll be carefully planned.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/Dd9bCPkhIw.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>It felt unnatural walking from the broad daylight into the dark club, early Friday night at Sneaky Pete’s. I wasn’t familiar with the bands on the bill making it hard to know what to expect from the night, but when the openers began it was clear what the crowd was in for: dance music. A bit out of place for so early on a Friday night, the crowd swayed along with only a few willing to break out and dance. The openers set the vibe for the night, playing full band alternative fusion and solo performance EDM.</p><p>Sonars hit the stage, a stage covered in equipment. Massive tables of loopers, sythns, and keyboards blocked in Frederick Paysden and Serena Oldrati. This left Paysden just enough space in the corner to jam on his guitar. The electro-psych duo began their set with a long looped track. It is fair to say that from this first song, I was not buying in. The loop seemed to stretch on and I felt lost in the multi-layered music.</p><p>However, the next song caught my interest and I was hooked. A looped rhythm section, samples, guitar and synth lines, and just a taste of lyrics; Sonars were captivating. You could feel it in the audience as very few people remained still. There was a motion and rhythm that almost couldn’t help but be danced to.</p><p>Desert Moon started and suddenly there were cheers from the crowd. Paysden and Oldrati looked both shocked and pleased continuing into the song that had everyone interested. Easily my favorite song of the night, it opened with a samples of space exploration recordings. Desert Moon brought a new energy while remaining true to the sound already established by the previous songs. Groovy, spacey, layered, and detailed, the elements were harmonious and the crowd responded excitedly.</p><p>As the show carried on, the crowd continued to dance and Sonars continued to feed us interesting tunes. They kept it serious with minimal on-stage banter and played a near continuous stream of songs. When Paysden did pause to address the audience, he expressed genuine thanks to the crowd, the other bands, and to the venue for the special night.</p><p>It seemed almost too soon when they announced it was their last song.</p><p>When the gig ended and the lights came on, I stood a bit disoriented. Sonars’ songs had engrossed me and I was not prepared for the release. Coming back to my senses, I quickly reflected that it had been a Friday night well spent. The music from all of the bands was full of interesting and complex instrumentation that could be appreciated by everyone. Sonars played a good set that kept the crowd moving along to it. Overall a night enjoyed.</p>",

It’s the hottest day of the year, but the atmosphere within is cool and calm, stirred only lightly by hushed chatter and the whispering flow of lager into pint glasses. There is a certain ease to the crowd which perfectly reflects the intimacy of the night to come, as Rhys Lewis and Declan J. Donovan draw their three-week European tour to a close in one of Glasgow’s West End venues.</p><p>First to grace the stage is Declan J. Donovan, an Essex-born songwriter and singer. Already, the personal nature and intimacy of his music is no secret. His demo<i> Fallen So Young</i> is a best man’s speech written to music, which he originally performed for his brother’s wedding. He has attributed the inspiration to write his most recent single, <i>The Human Way, </i>to the change of perspective which followed the birth of his nephew. The honesty of his song-writing merges the relationship between performer and audience to almost that of a confession and his confidante; a dynamic enhanced by the spell-bound silence which he casts upon the crowd. It may not be the reaction usually expected form Glaswegian gig-goers, but the mellow crowd makes the perfect companion to the honesty of his set.</p><p>The evening’s head-line act is Rhys Lewis. Another performer of the singer-songwriter variety but no doppelganger of his predecessor on the stage – often the danger for the stereotyped “man-with-acoustic-guitar”. His soul-filled stage presence seamlessly moves the vibe from the intimate front-room gig of Donovan to a down-town broken-hearted Blues bar. Indeed, the personal nature of his music is no less intimate, but here the topic is one-track, as he wrenches out the difficulties of heartbreak though the tracks of his EP <i>Bad Timing</i>, released in February. Accompanying his guitar with only a set of keys, a stripped back version of the band he toured with, but perfectly suited to the low-key setting, Lewis’ voice took centre stage, and resonated nearly as loudly as his lyrics. Highlights of his set included the minimalistic <i>Reasons to Hate You </i>and the border-line ballad of his 2017 single <i>Be Your Man</i>.</p><p>The world of the acoustic song-writer can often seem to be a game of “Heads you lose, Tails I win” where artists struggle between the potential obscurity of the poet, and the cheesy desperation of your dad’s cover band. But both Monday night’s acts brought out the best that such a genre has to offer, where raw talent and careful artistry work to create a genuine relationship between the performer, his music and its audience. Truly, listening to both Donovan and Lewis feels very much like getting to know them. And if that is the case, then one might wonder if a second date beside the Clyde might bring us a little closer to falling in love.</p><p>Review Written by Mary Sheard</p>",

      "title": "You Were Never Really Here Review",
      "html": "<p>In any creative endeavour, the possibility that one’s work will be judged through the (normally rose-tinted) lens of comparison is almost unavoidable. The <i>Trout Mask Replica </i>or <i>2001: A Space Odyssey </i>veneer of originality of almost invariably applied long after the stamp of excellence has been created by public and critical acceptance. Much of the pre-release discussion of Lynne Ramsay’s latest film <i>You Were Never Really Here</i> focused on the comparisons to films like <i>Taxi Driver, Le Samourai, </i>and the more recent <i>Drive</i>, but while these films share narrative and stylistic similarities to both the film version of <i>You Were Never Really Here </i>and Jonathan Ames’ novella upon which it is based, the editorial approach taken by Ramsay prevents her latest project from becoming hackneyed. In the age of big name, big budget, cinematic-universe event films, the tightly paced and muscular brevity of the film is refreshing, and much needed. As Joaquin Phoenix’s Joe lurches through the one of the grimmest depictions of the American east-coast in decades, the picture refuses to stand-on-ceremony, every scene exists to drive Joe, and the viewer, towards the grinding conclusion that is clearly coming. <i>You Were Never Really Here</i> is consciously indebted to Scorsese’s blood soaked brothel shootout in <i>Taxi Driver</i>, and the societal degradation and paranoia of <i>Serpico</i>’s final dénouement in a New York tenement. Intriguingly, Ramsay herself will be the draw for many viewers, as 2011’s <i>We Need to Talk About Kevin </i>has drawn a larger and larger following, largely thanks to a lengthy stay on Netflix, to the Scottish director. The other two standout names from the team, Phoenix and Jonny Greenwood are, for all their talent, relatively low key individuals, at least by Hollywood standards, and the film benefits from this; the cinema-go’er is saved from the ever-present overacting of the contemporary Hollywood prestige leading man, or needless Oscar seeking post-production additions. The pace and single mindedness of the original novella, at just 92 pages, and the adapted screenplay, do have their drawbacks, as the film speeds past characters and motivations, leaving it up to the viewer to interpret the flashbacks that communicate Joe’s wordless internal monologue. Some viewers are certain to be turned off by this technique, as are others by the recurrent physical and sexual violence that make up the bulk of the film.</p><p>The promise and premise of the film is enacted in the centrepiece scene, which occurs surprisingly early in the film, as Joe looks to rescue a girl from an underae brothel. Shot almost entirely through CCTV cameras, the silent, unflinching view of Joaquin Phoenix violently dispatching guards on his way to rescue Nina, his job to save her clearly playing second fiddle to his, and the audience’s, need for brutal catharsis at the end of a blunt hammer. The reintroduction of dialogue and the return to traditional camerawork comes too early, and separates the film from true auteur cinema, however, the stark simplicity of Lynne Ramsay’s vision and trust in her audience. <i>You Were Never Really Here </i>is likely the most challenging mainstream release so far this year, but well worth the investment for those willing to take a more constructive view of the often difficult violence.</p><p><em>You Were Never Really Here</em> is playing at Edinburgh FilmHouse</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/kKp4nHXkzx.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Following the January release of their latest album <i>I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life</i>, Tune-Yards are currently touring all over the UK, Europe and the US with a jam-packed schedule. On Wednesday 14<sup>th</sup>, Merrill Garbus’ band graced the stage at Liquid Rooms for a high-energy set that took us through the new album whilst revisiting some of the band’s most popular records.</p><p>Tune-Yards consists of Garbus on vocals, ukulele and an impressive array of loop pedals, joined by Nate Brenner on bass and synths. Currently drumming with them on tour is Hamir Atwal, a respected percussionist in his own right. The band’s sound is highly percussive, with clear world-music influences as well as shades of house music in their more recent material, punctuated by Garbus’ distinctive and powerful vocals.</p><p>Touring with Tune-Yards currently is the Boogarins, who produced a fantastic warm-up set to an already packed Liquid Rooms. The Brazilian band’s psych pop sound got plenty of heads bobbing and they received a hearty and well-deserved cheer from the crowd. If you haven’t already come across them, I would highly recommend checking out Boogarins’ latest album <i>Lá Vem a Morte</i>.</p><p>Come 9pm, Tune-Yards unassumingly wander onto the stage, enthusiastically greeted by the crowd, and begin their set with ‘Home’. Garbus’ vocals drift over a stripped back accompaniment from Atwal and Brenner on drums and bass in an atmospheric start to the set. Half way through the track the tempo jumps up and the crowd bursts into life as Garbus makes her way out from behind her microphone to the front of the stage. Following this jump up in energy, the band moves seamlessly from ‘Home’ onto ‘Look at your hands’, ‘ABC 123’<i> </i>and ‘Water Fountain’. ‘Water Fountain’, the band’s best-known song, is greeted by a rapturous cheer from the crowd and some vigorous dancing ensues as Garbus demonstrates her highly skilled use of the looping equipment, accompanied by fervent strobe-lighting.</p><p>After these first four tracks whip Liquid Rooms up into quite a frenzy, the band takes a moment to pause and say a quick thank you before reining things in a little bit with a beautiful rendition of ‘Powa’ followed by a return to a higher energy with ‘Colonizer’. House music’s influence on the band shines through as ‘Colonizer’ is followed by a hectic acid-house style break, with Atwal and Brenner working together to create a huge sound whilst Garbus crouches over her looping and sampling apparatus, evidently re-programming things for the second half of the set.</p><p>Garbus conducts the audience through the second half of the set, waving a baton at them in time with tunes from ‘Coast to Coast’ to ‘Gangsta’ before stopping to say a thank you to the whole team, giving particular thanks to Fred on the lights who had made the show visually spectacular. The set closed with the opening song from the new album, ‘Heart Attack’, although it wasn’t long before the band are welcomed back onto the stage following cries of ‘one more song!’. The band re-emerges to finish off the set in great style with ‘Bizness’<i> </i>followed by the anthemic ‘Free’. From start to finish the gig was an excellent exhibition of the band’s varied catalogue, transitioning from bare vocals and ukulele into heavy house industrial beats and keeping the audience captivated throughout.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/x9HQ_Hh2uq.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>After releasing her second studio album, ‘<i>Someone Out There</i>’, at the start of last month, Blackpool’s very own Rae Morris has just begun her UK wide tour, making her only Scottish stop off at the The Art School, a compact venue located within the Glasgow School of Art. Nevertheless, Morris manages to cram the room full of her rapidly growing fan base.</p><p>Understanding the incredible capabilities of her own voice and instrumental talent to captivate an audience, Morris only requires three other instrumentalists on stage to create her unique sound. She begins with, ‘Push Me to My Limit’, a track which doesn’t really seem to go anywhere but instead just hangs in the air with ambient beauty, a real opening statement of, “Yeah, I can sing really well”. This is cleverly mixed into one of the more upbeat electronic songs of the album, ‘Reborn’, which was released as a single back in 2015.  This is also where we get our first glimpse of Morris’ interesting style of onstage freestyle dance.</p><p>The set continues with tracks such as ‘Wait for the Rain’, a powerful synth ridden dance track and ‘Rose Garden’, a more intense song ending with an almost rave breakdown, a strange yet exciting juxtaposition from the relatively calm nature of the rest of Morris’ performance. ‘Do It’, one of the big pop songs from the album, receives a huge reaction from the crowd as well as ‘Love Again’, one of the largest hits from her previous album. Morris performs another previous album hit, ‘Cold’, which had originally featured her recording partner, Fryars. In his absence, Morris brings forward her drummer, who performs an emotional rendition of one of Rae’s biggest love songs. Unfortunately, the impact of this track and various others are rather let down by the lack of intricacy in the lighting display, which somewhat resembles being at a school disco and fails to emphasise the light and shade of the dynamic music.</p><p>Before beginning ‘Dancing with Character’, Morris explains how the song was written about her best friend’s grandparents who used to “dance their nights away in the working man’s clubs of Blackpool”. Although the Grandmother passed away, her spouse refused to let the feelings stop him from dancing and, as sang by Rae, “He’ll never stop dancing ‘til he’s back with her”. The song plays testament to the genuine sentimental connection Morris has with her songs and lyrics. She radiates positivity and happiness throughout her performance, which gives a much more intimate audience to singer connection.</p><p>As if the set had not already sparked a series of heartfelt emotions in the crowd, Morris finishes an overwhelming set with her title track, ‘Someone Out There’. She dedicates the track to BBC Radio 1’s Greg James, who has just completed a humongous charitable endeavor to raise money for Sport Relief. Morris explains how he has helped the song become what it truly is, a beacon of light in the campaign to raise awareness of Mental Health illnesses and the stigma that surrounds them. The crowd really connects with this song, applauding Morris as she begins her way into the crowd to socialise with her fans.</p><p>In the seemingly endless world of Pop, Rae Morris has turned up and finally given the genre the irregularity it needs. She is a down to earth, utterly lovely woman who makes music because she wants to let people know about her feelings and her emotions. She hid nothing and left everything she possibly could have on this Glasgow stage, an impressive feat recollecting that this was only one night of a UK wide tour. She has proven to a regular critic of pop music that it really can mean something, and for that I have the utmost respect.</p>",

      "title": "Wiley at The Liquid Room",
      "html": "<p><em>Writers: Rebecca Somer &amp; Mariam Sadoun</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/JMUS6gehmQ.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>While promoting his upcoming album <em>Godfather II</em>, Wiley makes a stop in Edinburgh at the unlikely grime venue, The Liquid Room. While grime has taken Britain and more recently the world by storm, it does not have a heavy presence in Edinburgh. Edinburgh’s lackluster feeling towards grime is reflected in the numbers. The gig is far from packed, and even at times feels somewhat empty with a large amount of free space even close to the stage. This could be because it was rescheduled due to the prior week’s Beast of the East snowstorm, but you would still expect a stronger turn out for the Godfather of Grime.</p><p>Despite the numbers, Wiley brings the heat and fittingly opens with ‘Been a While’, a single released less than a month ago from his highly anticipated <em>Godfather II</em> studio album. This solid, icy performance is inline with all that his trademark ‘eskibeat’ flow stands for. It emits the classic pulsating grime sound that Wiley originated. Another strong moment is his sharp execution of another recent tune, ‘I Call the Shots’, which was the first single released from the upcoming album. As the night progresses, Wiley shifts from new to old music, demonstrating his ability to create hits that withstand the test of time. He performs classic throwbacks like ‘Heatwave’, ‘Too Many Man’, and ‘Wearing My Rolex’ that definitely invigorate the crowd and his avid fans. Wiley is also sharp and focused during the delivery of his verse on the Roll Deep collab track ‘I Will Not Lose’. Given Wiley only has a few verses on this shared five minute original track, the DJ takes it from there and mixes it up by dropping some cool samples against the electric skittering bassline. Overall, his older tracks seem to liven and resonate with the audience most, and this is something Wiley is aware of. He has told numerous sources that <em>Godfather II</em> will be his last ever album due to his age and waning support.</p><p>Despite the fact that Wiley’s time in the limelight may be up, he still brings his a-game and leaves a memorable mark on the audience. Whilst Wiley joined the music scene likely before much of the audience was born, the generational gap is barely noticeable. The crowd absorbs Wiley’s energy and moshes the night away to his fast-beat, polyrhythmic sounds. This highlights how the relevance of Wiley’s music transcends generations of youth. From his early days creating garage music with college friends to starting grime with his crew Roll Deep up until today where he continues making grime-electro fusion bangers that appeal to the masses, Wiley is clearly a multi-talented, versatile artist, and it is sad to see his career approach its end. No matter what, Wiley has cemented his legendary status in the U.K. music scene, so he can now kick back and watch budding talent continue to take the British sound into unexplored territories just like he did nearly two decades ago.</p><p>Wiley is known to be a great supporter of many up-and-coming grime artists. With this inclusive spirit, he brings out two unknown guest artists towards the end of his set. Although the crowd does not receive them with too much enthusiasm, kudos to Wiley for supporting local talent and extending his platform. It is a shame though that the second group he brings out end up closing the show. Though this guest group attempts to sustain the prior energy generated, it does not live up and results in an anticlimactic ending to the show. We would have much preferred one final farewell from the Godfather himself.</p>",

Put it this way: it’s hard not to begrudge Tom Misch his success when we were both born in 1995 but only one of us is beginning a two-month European and North American tour.</p><p>I take solace only in the fact that Tom Misch’s success is well-earned. His popularity is undoubtedly deserved. His show in The Venue at Glasgow’s Oran Mor is testament to this popularity, particularly among young people who comprise most of the crowd. Their singing and enthusiasm for his brand of relaxed J Dilla-esque jazz is indication that they don’t feel bitter about his age. Any of the bitterness I once held towards the very successful 22-year-old dissipates as Tom Misch begins his 90 minute set with ‘The Journey’, the lo-fi violin-looping opener to Beat Tape 2.</p><p>The set continues with ‘Colours of Freedom’, a guitar frilled dance track and ‘I Wish’ a slower blend of lounge-style jazz and hip-hop beats punctuated by a funky walking bassline. ‘It Runs Through Me’, Misch’s newest bossa-inspired single from the upcoming debut album (Geography, to be released April 2018) is one of Misch’s many crowd-pleasers throughout the show. Others include the instrumental cover of Stevie Wonder’s ‘Isn’t She Lovely’ (the crowd provides the vocals) and later he brings his sister, actor Polly Misch, to the stage for ‘Movie’, where she recreates the dialogue from the start of the song.</p><p>The mellow, grooving twist which he applies to various genres- funk, soul, hip-hop and smooth jazz to name a few- is perhaps derived from 15 year old Misch’s love of producer J Dilla. Jaydee’s chill, head-bobbing brand of hiphop, for example, is echoed in the lowkey beats which underscore all of Tom Misch’s music. Misch has, naturally, also accrued other musical influences since 15. An example is ‘Tick-Tock’, a new song from Geography, in which the influence of Massive Attack’s ‘Teardrop’ is audible. The song wells up in a crescendo of violin and the ticking of a clock, building up to fill the room before finally breaking into an upbeat dance track.</p><p>Tom Misch’s eclectic inspirations are perhaps both a boon and a hindrance. On the one hand, it allows him to explore and experiment with a wide range of musical sources. On the other hand, it means that his music occasionally veers toward being poor imitations of other artists’ sounds. Tom Misch is a young artist, yet to define a sound that is truly his. The music that he makes is agreeable if not second-hand, but he has a passion for beat-making and a knack for crowd-pleasing which will no doubt improve with age. This I cannot begrudge him</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/GJMFJcEPgF.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Romeo and Juliet- Edinbrugh University Shakespeare Company at Pleasance Theatre: Tuesday 6th - Saturday 10th March, 1930.</p><p>The stage of the Pleasance Theatre is expansive, especially with the addition of a thrust and I felt that the set did not make full use of the opportunities afforded it. The architecturally sloped flats were a drab navy blue, which detracted from their interesting shape. Juliet’s window, wheeled around by two faithful chorus members, was underwhelming and often distracting when it got stuck in the wings. The only real points of interest were a scrappy light sculpture, disproportionately small, and a device using material stretched over the flats and back lighting to create a temporary window. The latter was effective when used, however it possible could have been used more.</p><p>During the audience-in the cast were arranged on the stage in a funereal tableau which nicely set the tone and without which the stage would have looked very bare, however as the production began they exited unceremoniously, rather detracting from the impact it had had. It was a nicely symbolic touch to have the Principal of Shakespeare Company Grace Dickson speak the prologue and onwards from this point the high standard of the acting meant that even with the small snags and weaknesses, this was a brilliant show.  Will Peppercorn in the role of Mercutio was wonderful; his Queen Mab speech was one of the highlights of the evening, and he, along with Michael Black as Benvolio and Kirsten Millar as the Nurse particularly possessed that rare gift with young actors of Shakespeare of being to convey the Baird’s words with absolute clarity, speaking them as naturally and spontaneously as if they were their own. This was largely true of the entire cast; even smaller roles were clearly in command of the language and performed with total conviction.</p><p>Millar deserves mention also for her comedy and energy. Alongside her, Joe Christie as Peter, also bought warm and charming comedy, and the pairing added variation to the tone of the production.</p><p>Eliza Lawrence made an endearing Juliet- it is easy to forget how two dimensional the role is, though she relied heavily on fidgety movements to create naturalism, which sometimes became distracting. I also felt that an opportunity was lost here with her costume. Lawrence is captivating but she seemed to be dressed as herself rather than the young, wealthy, beautiful Juliet. Her ball dress was an unusual dull green two piece that carried no impact on stage, especially alongside the jewel tone dresses worn by Lady Capulet and other chorus members. There were some outstanding costumes, such as those of Lady Capulet and Escalus but overall, inconsistency gave the production the appearance of a rehearsal.</p><p>Maddy Willing’s composition supported the production beautifully. It was particularly effective during some of Romeo’s early speeches, when Finlay McAfee’s directorial skill first showed its hand. The cast were frozen in intricately constructed tableaux, allowing Romeo to move between them towards Juliet, captivated by her beauty. Douglas Clark is a very fiery Romeo and gives the role more graity than it sometimes has, for which he must be commended. Fight scenes were also slick, exciting, and full of energy, especially between Tybalt and Romeo. Blood and retractable blades, so often at risk of being gimmicky, were well deployed. The only minor weakness was that the choreography had omitted to consider the audience members like ourselves who were seated on either side of the thrust, so that certain illusions, though surely impactful from further back in the auditorium were lost for us.</p><p>This was a thoroughly enjoyable evening of theatre and a fine example of the acting talent in Edinburgh. It would be an ideal “first Shakespeare play” to see, and one might reasonably expect this to be the case for some audience members. It was perhaps not the show stopping 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary production that Shakespeare Society had promised us but a production to be proud of nonetheless and I am sure that many of the glitches will be ironed out by Saturday evening.</p>",

      "title": "Hidden Door Launch Party Review",
      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/DIKcaMixnu.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><em>via Hidden Door Blog</em></p><p>For the music lovers of Edinburgh, it can be frustrating to find out that the live music scene is dying. Some of Edinburgh’s most creative and bravest minds are coming together to put an end to the malaise. The Hidden Door festival is a brilliant concept. In 2017, they took the abandoned Old Leith Theatre and turned it into the main festival venue. This year, right across, they discovered the abandoned Former State Cinema. The festival aims to provide a mainstream platform to audiences who are looking to establish themselves in the music industry. Local artists from Edinburgh are obviously favoured.</p><p>The Launch Party, which was hosted at the Liquid Rooms, featured three acts. Four acts were initially intended, but due to the weather conditions, Pronto Mama, weren’t able to come and perform. The show carried on with the other three scheduled performers, Midi Paul, Reverse Engineer and Ela Orleans. Midi Paul was the opener, walking onto the stage with his bass guitar, hooked up to the various gadgets on the DJ table. He started off with a synthy post-disco groove. He simultaneously played the bass, while adding instrumental layers with midi launch pad in front of him. Midi Paul’s artistic diversity was really on display, blending elements of electronic, progressive rock and dub into his set. While the music was mixed well and Paul is obviously talented, the set up limited the experience of the performance a bit. The long table that stretched from one end of the stage to the other felt like a barrier that led to somewhat of a restrained performance. At times, it felt like the audience checked out of the music, focusing more on their conversations than the music.</p><p>Reverse engineering was up next, offering a mix of proto-jungle, proto-techno and house. His music emits the nostalgia of a music scene from the 70s or the 80s. The energy slow seeps into the crowd, as people begin to dance. The Reverse Engineer has a very meticulous approach to his sets, incrementally adding a new sound into the fold as the mix goes on. It’s easy to tell that The Reverse Engineer is excited to be here, getting jiggy to his music, behind the table. Again the table, really feels like a barrier to enjoying this launch party more. Scenes for genres such as house and electric usually have a very intimate setting, at the end of the day DJ’s are really just normal people like us. Considering that this is not a big arena, the confrontational nature of the setting is a bit of limitation when it comes to enjoying the concert more.</p><p>Ela Orleans is the closer. To see the talented Polish artist, based in Glasgow is an exciting prospect. Orleans joins the stage and begins to set up, asking the audience to quiet down. They oblige. The barrier-like set up of the tables suits her personality best, as you get the sense that she is more of an introverted type who conveys the intimacy of her music through the sounds she uses. Ela Orleans is like a more refined blend of the first two performances at the launch. She provides some very swingy beats, which slowly transform into beautifully harmonized tunes. A lot of personality is felt with the quirky sounds that she adds into each song. Orleans’ vocals give off an eerie-sort of vibe, they seem to have an important role in the overall experience of her music. At times the music can get irritating as it’s impossible to really hear Orleans’ vocals properly. While you get a basic sense of the pitch and the tone, it feels like you’re not truly experiencing true extent of Orleans’ talent.</p><p>The Hidden Door Festival is obviously a huge deal. It should be a mandatory event for every resident in Edinburgh, if such a law existed. While you get a bit of a taste of what to expect through the visuals and the musical performances, the launch wasn’t without its dull moments. It’s perfectly fine for music to be a conversational lubricant, but at times it felt like people were more interested in their conversations than the music. That might speak to the people in attendance or the fact that there weren’t any performers who could really get the crowd up and dancing. After all, the launch is for a festival, the performers are obviously talented, but it was hard to truly get a festive sense from the event.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://consequenceofsound.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/black-star.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><em>via Consequence of Sound</em></p><p>The year is 1998, future meme-worthy songs such as “My Heart Will Go On”, “Believe” and “I Don’t Wanna Miss a Thing” top the charts. Hip-hop is still recovering from the from the deaths of Biggie Smalls and 2pac. For many, the murders of these larger than life figures signals the end of rap’s golden era. Out of the dying embers of that era, Mos Def and Talib Kweli, as Black Star emerged.</p><p>Both emcees were already known in the boroughs of New York as prodigious lyricists. Black Star was an amalgamation of all of hip-hop’s best aspects. They didn't just impact the listener sonically, they used the canvas of the mind. You’re taken to the streets of Harlem, you’re put into the shoes of a young African-American. Black Star is a story, it’s a history lesson about struggle and triumph.</p><p>Historically Black Star was the name of a ship, bought by Marcus Garvey to bolster the African global economy. Marcus Garvey was a hero in the community, serving as the leader of the Universal Negro Improvement Association. The Black Star Line derived its name from the White Star Line, a prominent shipping corporation owned by the British. Garvey didn’t just think he could match the success of the White Star Line, but outdo them.</p><p>Black Star indulges the listener with a detailed account of what its like to be a young African American growing up in Harlem.</p><p>Sometimes focusing too much on the bigger picture dilutes the message. Black Star was able to tread this line masterfully. They touched on themes such as African-American esteem, culture, love and pride. Everything is told through a personal story, through the experiences of the black youth.</p><p>“Definition” is inspired by the Boogie Down Productions song “Stop the Violence”. Kweli and Mos Def philosophize the concept of death in the black community, pointing to all the martyrs who have struggled for black independence. They interpolate “Children’s Story” by Slick Rick, turning it into a tale of how a frustrated black child resorts to crime when society has failed to give him the opportunity to succeed. In the story, the boy resorts to alcoholism and drugs to numb the pain and dull his conscience. Ultimately, he is cornered by society’s “enforcers”, the police who take his life. “B Boys Will B Boys”, is a throwback to breakdance scene, which hip hop was born out of in the late 1970s. “Respiration” is one of the most stirring tracks on the album. It’s a poetic juxtaposition of despair and hope. It parodies the idea of New York being the city that never sleeps. While the saying often has a positive connotation, here it means insomnia. Gun violence till the crack of dawn. Mos Def and Talib Kweli, find their source of inspiration in the beauty of the moon hanging over the New York skyline like a crown. The brisk night air is intoxicating, a breath of new life.</p><p>The entire album is produced by Hi-Tek, who had worked extensively as Kweli’s counterpart in Reflection Eternal. Hi-Tek doesn’t experiment into any new territory in his tracks, but that’s not where the beauty of his production lies. It’s the selection of samples, which capture the spirit of the album. The sampling of artists such as Gil Scott-Heron, Minnie Ripperton, Boogie Down Productions, even the documentary Style Wars, sent out a strong artistic message. Each sample brought a taste of flair and authenticity that embellished the Black Star ethos.</p><p>Twenty years on, this album lives as a fable. It’s a pillar of strength for the African-American community. To this day, it’s the only release under Black Star. Mos Def and Talib Kweli went on to have successful individual careers, but fans have always craved a sequel. Given the current climate of race relations in the United States, this is a likely prospect. Black Star couldn’t be more relevant. Fortunately, it looks like a reunion could be in the mix, with Madlib rumored to be supplying Black Star with production. Here’s to the Black Star sequel being as timeless as its predecessor.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/-CmYXs1P9a.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Walking into the Bedlam Theatre it was nearly unrecognizable. The company of Our Country’s Good has transformed the stage, extending it into the audience, replacing the space lost to this extension with seating around the edges of the stage. Taking advantage of this, I sat myself in one of the on-stage seats. It was before I could get over my slight discomfort of not being another face in a crowd, that the play began. The lights dropped and suddenly there were bone chilling screams. This first scene depicted the travel of the convict ships to Australia in a vividly raw way. The screams rose from a character that was being brutally whipped. Immediately and without warning the play had started, the tone was set and the audience was engrossed.</p><p>This production of Our Country’s Good was impressive, and my biggest issues were with the script itself. I occasionally found myself lost in the dialogue as the scene-setting speech was hidden within the guise of other conversations. Even then, I quickly forgot about this confusion as the play continued.</p><p>The acting was incredible. Most actors took on two roles, one of a convict and one of an officer. Flipping between the abuser and the abused required talent: an ability to shift your tone, attitude and intention. It also highlighted the fact that all the characters are people, no matter their traits. That being said, the stand out performances were found within the convict characters. The humanity, pain, emotion, love, loss, struggle, joy, humor, and redemption captured by the convict characters played on the hearts of the audience, keeping us engrossed in their stories, as well as the wider play. Liz, played by Tiffany Garnham, is a brilliant character brilliantly portrayed. The idea of redemption flowed from her story line, along with a pain and sympathy that is undeniable. Duckling and Wisehammer, played by Anna Swinton and Matthew Sedman respectively, offered the audience emotional performances. The character of Duckling gave a raw and often discomforting tale of brutal love, while Wisehammer was powerfully endearing. The officers were essential to the story and well portrayed, but, as I believe is the purpose of the play, it was the convicts that sold the show.</p><p>It is important to note the goal of this play. Our Country’s Good tells the tale of redemption in order to show the humanity of prisoners and raise questions in the audience about the current treatment of people in the prison system. This production was immaculately done. I give credit to the directors, Luke Morley and Jane Prinsley, as they captured this theme and conveyed it to the audience. I believe there was not a single audience member that did not walk away with, at least, sympathy for the convicts if not a deep heart break at the conditions displayed.</p><p>This production of Our Country’s Good, showing at Bedlam Theatre from the 26th of February to the 3rd of March, was a striking production that I am glad I did not miss.</p>",

      "html": "<p>St. Luke’s stands alone in a strangely vacant lot in eastern Glasgow, a hulking and menacing monument not too far from the Necropolis cemetery. Out of habit, I arrived a bit late, but I truly wish I hadn’t. Arriving on time would have allowed me more time to watch and listen to Jo Quail, a London-based experimental electric cellist. Opening for two of the heaviest music acts in history as a solo string instrumentalist must be nerve-wracking, but Quail’s set was brilliant and deeply moving. Using only a loop pedal, Quail manages to summon sounds out of her cello that seem impossible. Each song is expansive and and includes dissonant wails and sounds that could have been mistaken for a kick drum had she not generated the sound with a bow and some strings right in front of the audience. Just a couple minutes into her set, it becomes clear why Boris invited her to join them – in her music was some similarity to the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4vRrGCVlMHk?t=1m50s\">early soundscapes</a> of post-rock groups like Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Boris’s reverence for that sound runs deep. That being said, Quail's sound is truly her own, and is asbolutely incredible.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/7RIdc9CEcp.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Jo Quail\"></figure><p>Jo Quail’s set ends, and Boris begins to set up. Boris is a legendary boundary-pushing metal band from Japan that has been fundamentally changing the field of heavy music for over 20 years. Among the objects on the stage are a gong, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akuma_no_Uta#Cover_art\">double-necked guitar</a>, and more amplifiers than one band should ever need. Boris walks on stage, and the crowd goes wild. And then the music actually starts. I’ll preface this section by saying that, in my opinion, Boris’s latest album was just good – a great exhibition of their sound, but nothing groundbreaking. None of that mattered when they began to play. The pure weight of Boris’s live performances is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/12/arts/music/12boris.html\">well known</a>, but nothing prepared me for the solid wall that hit me. Sound structure as a concept dissolves, and the next hour or so is spent embracing loudness as an art form. It is bliss. This is not to say that that the musicianship itself isn’t amazing, because it is. Atsuo’s ferocious stamina on the kit is awe-inspiring, and Wata’s wispy vocals are an incredible accompaniment to the heaviness. But when songs meld together and you can feel the guitar tone in your core, more traditional measures of a live set are less consequential.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/R8Mo1K17nL.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Boris\"></figure><p>The set ends (with a brutal wall of noise), and Amenra enters. A Belgian atmospheric sludge metal band with their share of critical acclaim, Amenra excels at pairing heaviness with unadulterated passion, and this set is no different. The band alternates between ambient interludes and head-banging heaviness, with the lead vocalist Colin van Eeckhout wailing his heart out. Hair-raising black and white visuals are projected on the back wall of St. Luke’s, and the audience throbs in time with Amenra’s hypnotic down-tuned riffs. Amenra’s music is formulaic, for better or for worse, and for someone who isn’t as familiar with their individual songs, the set begins to get slightly repetitive. This, however, is my only critique; Amenra was fantastic overall.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/OV-AntGy_b.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Amenra\"></figure><p>Do these bands sound interesting?

      "html": "<p><strong>Adele Thomas proves that Conor McPherson's classic text still has the power to unnerve in this production of <em>The Weir</em> by the English Touring Theatre.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/YJx2jpstcw.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Photo Credit: Marc Brenner.</p><p>The English Touring Theatre have revived Conor McPherson's 1997 classic <em>The Weir,</em> which performed at King's Theatre Edinburgh this week as part of their UK tour.</p><p>One of the most striking elements of <em>The Weir</em> was the set, designed by Madeleine Girling. The set comprised of a three-walled structure placed within the main stage, giving the audience a peek inside the interior of the titular pub in which the action occurs. The hemmed in, smoke-stained walls created a homely yet claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the actors little room to move around yet also focussing the audience's attention in on the bar around which the actors cluster.</p><p>A flash of strobe and the action begins. The Weir is the kind of pub familiar to anyone from a rural area – the kind where regulars assemble day after day to chatter and drink the grim, windy night away. Things shift a little, however, with the arrival of Valerie, just moved here from Dublin.</p><p>Endless pints are downed and banter flies between the old patrons of the pub and an out-of-place Valerie, sensitively played by Natalie Radmall-Quirke. Talk turns to the spiritual; each patron takes their turn to tell a ghostly story.</p><p>It is a play with very little on-stage action, which necessarily relies on the actor's ability to hold audience attention through their storytelling. All actors managed this with success, though some Irish accents and dialect took a little while to adjust to.</p><p>The climax of the play comes with Valerie's chilling story of her lost child, more haunting than any of the previous ghost stories. Adele Thomas's direction captures the poignancy of the moment, though the importance of the speech is at times undercut by Radmall-Quirke's failure to project.</p><p>Lee Curran's lighting design is hugely successful in establishing the eery atmosphere and must be praised. Whilst each actor performed their monologue, the lighting changed almost imperceptibly from the warm pub atmosphere to bathing the stage in a blue light which echoed the tragic ending of Valerie's child. The subtle yet overall dramatic lighting changes and slow lighting changes created an overall dramatic visual landscape.</p><p>The only aspect which undermines the overall atmosphere is the use of background music – sometimes a 'haunting' fiddle, sometimes eery chimes in the wind. These additions were unnecessary and even slightly amateur; they undercut the sincerity of the monologues, which were performed mainly as naturalistic.</p><p>Overall, this production of <em>The Weir</em> captured the claustrophobic but ultimately good-natured atmosphere of a small-town pub. The men's supernatural stories are endlessly revised and retold – until they meet a woman with a new and chilling story to tell. <em>The Weir</em> is a play about the things that might have been, and the things you should have done; Thomas's direction plays well on the subtle sadness of the ending, and Valerie's monologue leaves an impact long after the blue light has faded.</p>",

The room was already busy for the support from Glaswegian quintet Spinning Coins, although they do little to get the crowd going. It seems the early birds were more focussed on getting a good spot for the main attraction.</p><p>When Alvvays do appear, it isn’t long before the atmosphere lifts and everyone is gently shuffling along, with a group of enthusiastic boppers down the front. The crowd feels familiar to me. These are the people who were going wild at the Two Door Cinema Club headlined NME tour back in the day, but now we’re all a little older and wiser.</p><p>The simple visuals projected behind the band in bold primary colours are squishy and primal; I’m reminded of the evolution of cells under a microscope. The abstract, dreamlike quality perfectly matches the soft, spacey vocals and they’re interesting enough to draw my eye without pulling focus.</p><p>The whole performance is stripped back, with little conversation between songs aside from Rankin remarking on the difficulty of pronouncing ‘Sauchiehall Street’, something any non-Scot will be able to relate to. Although she isn’t chatty, Rankin is an engaging frontperson and her crystal clear vocals cut through the music beautifully. Alvvays are not a band about big personalities, and I really appreciate her understated presence as the driving force of the performance.</p><p>The set is a mix of tracks from Alvvays’s first self-titled album and their 2017 offering <em>Antisocialites, </em>but with only one track from <em>Antisocialites</em> unplayed it’s evident that this tour is the showcase for their new material<em>.</em> The newer tracks fit in seamlessly with the older ones. After opening appropriately with ‘Hey’, the mood is high throughout the set, though it’s definitely old favourites like ‘Archie Marry Me’ that really get everyone going,</p><p>Towards the end of the set they play ‘Dreams Tonight’ and the ABC’s enormous disco ball begins to spin, throwing glittering light all over the room. This is the magical moment I choose to put on my Snapchat story, and the positive response I got confirms it was the highlight of the gig.</p><p>The no-fuss encore consists of an Elastica cover and ‘Next of Kin’. It’s the perfect goodbye, leaving us all wanting a little more and in doing so ensuring that they’ll be back gracing another Glasgow venue soon.  It’s a pacey, no-frills set which demonstrates Alvvays’s wide appeal. Based on their first two excellent albums, I’m certainly excited by the prospect of new music from these delicate and thoughtful musicians who already have a strong following hanging on their every riff.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/PKgf5zcqzd.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Austrian duo, Sophie Lindinger and Marco Kleebauer, are making waves in the alternative music scene as they tour around Europe as the band Leyya; a quirky and creative twist on electronic indie-pop. Their second studio album <i>Sauna</i> is an eclectic mix of groovy and vibrant beats, which demonstrates a more light-hearted and funky vibe than its predecessor, <i>Spanish Disco</i>. Leyya really know how to mix it up, alternating between soft haunting vocals, catchy hooks and intriguing drum solos. The smooth and dreamy ambience of <i>Sauna</i> takes you on a journey as the album explores an array of unique sounds and textures in a world where <i>\"everything is the same\"</i>. Despite their hectic schedule, I managed to chat to Leyya before their gig in the Waiting Room in London last week.</p><p><b>So you're playing tonight at the Waiting Room in London. Have you played there before?</b></p><p>No. We've played in London, yes, but this is our first time in the Waiting Room. It's a really nice, small venue. It's pretty sweet for a small club.</p><p><b>What kind of venues do you prefer playing in?</b></p><p>It depends, I guess. I think the most important thing is the audience. You can have a very cool and intimate audience with 800 people, and you can have the same thing with 100 people. It depends on how the audience reacts to the music.</p><p><b>Where are you looking forward to performing on tour? Anywhere you have never been?</b></p><p>I mean, there are so many cities that we have never been to that we will be going to within the next few weeks, so we are really looking forward to all of it. The thing is, normally we don't really have time to actually visit the city, so it depends on how much time we have. But we are going to play in Mexico and Austin in March, and we do have time to see a few places there. I am actually really looking forward to that.</p><p><b>Do you spend a while deciding what to wear before you play a gig, or does it really matter to you?</b></p><p><i>[Laughs]</i> I don't think that we think a lot about what we are going to wear. Normally we just have a few pieces of clothes with us, because we don't have the room to bring a lot of clothes, so there are not that many options. We have like 4 or 5 outfits that we always use and then we just decide which one to use on that night. The most important thing is that we wear colours, and not just black and white clothes.</p><p><b>Right now you are on tour promoting your new album <i>Sauna</i>. How was the creative process behind <i>Sauna</i> different from when you created your first album, <i>Spanish Disco</i>?</b></p><p>Well the thing is, with the first album, it feels like you have time forever because nobody knows you and nobody is waiting for your music. With the second album, people actually want to hear your new music, so there is a little bit of pressure and you work differently. But we tried not to think about the pressure and we wanted to take our time. We actually postponed the release of our album three times or so, because we were not really happy with everything, and we wanted to make an album that were 100% happy with, which was a little bit harder than we thought. With the album, we tried to combine new ideas and create new ways of writing. We took ideas from everywhere; from different cultures, from different stories, and from different perspectives.  We tried not to limit ourselves with sound. At first, we thought that we had to create the same sound that we created in the first album. But then at one point we decided not to do that, so we got creative and just did whatever came to our minds. I guess, that was a little bit different than what we did with the first one, because with the first one we had one sound in mind and we wanted to do exactly that, but with the second one we  just tried and tried and whatever we liked, we kept. So we just played around and made stupid ideas with the songs.</p><p><b>What is the meaning behind the name <i>Sauna</i>, and why did you choose that as the album title?</b></p><p>We chose that name for a few different reasons. The first time we thought about the title <i>Sauna</i>, was when we were doing a recording a few years ago. We recorded a few instruments in a wooden cabin - like a small wooden house on a landside - and there were no windows and it was pretty hot; it was in summer. We posted a picture on social media and someone commented like, <i>\"haha the new album title is going to be Sauna\"</i>. And I think that was the very first time that we heard that, and we thought, that's pretty cool actually. We didn't really think about it when we wrote the songs but when we were close to finishing the songs, we remembered that comment and we thought that <i>Sauna</i> is actually pretty cool, because the word looks quite round and it's a really nice word to say, and that's the idea that we want to create with the music as well; a nice, round, floating theme. And we liked the idea behind it; that people are in a sauna with no clothes, and they don't have material things to show. In that room, they are all naked; everyone is just the same. It's a pretty nice idea, and that's what we wanted to do with the music as well. We wanted to combine every sound, so we'd have a sound from one country and then another sound from one genre; and it would be like everything is the same.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/4K7iJGbdA5.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><b>The album artwork is gorgeous, who created it?</b></p><p>Thank you! I painted the woman on the cover and Marco did the collage of the rainbow and the blue background. We want to always create everything that stands for us, we want to make it ourselves as it represents us and we don't want someone else to do that because they mostly don't know what we want. So we just make it ourselves.</p><p><b>Which song from the album means the most to you?</b></p><p>Well, that's a hard question because we worked on every track for a long time and we did a lot for every song because we wanted to make it 100% perfect for us, and it's hard to say which one is the favourite out of that as each one is somehow special in our eyes. So I can't really decide but maybe I would say 'In Your Head', because I really like that its very smooth and soft in the beginning and in the end its very hard, loud and heavy. That's what I like; the combination of these two things.</p><p><b>Do you guys have a say in the production of the music videos?</b></p><p>We are involved in that, because again, it is something that represents us. We want to tell our story with everything that we do, so we try to involve ourselves in everything. If you work with someone making these videos, you always have to collaborate and work together. They have an idea and we have an idea, and then we combine these ideas into one video. So we are involved, and we don't want to publish something that someone else did for us. We want to say something with our work, and that includes our videos too.</p><p><b>After listening to your new album, it's evident that your sound is always evolving - are there any songs that you've recorded that you'd like to go back and change in any way?</b></p><p>I think we accept the album as it is. I mean, that's what we did a few years ago, and this is what we do now. You change as a person all the time and that's what you do when you make  music; your music changes as well. I wouldn't say that I would do something differently with the songs. The song is how it is, that's how we wrote it back then, and we liked it back then, so it's okay!</p><p><b>Do you have plans to start writing a third album or will you both take a break after your tour?</b></p><p>We always make music and when we finished the album, we started making music again. That's how it works. But we don't really have a plan to release an album soon. We'll just make music and we'll see where it takes us, and maybe we'll make so many songs that we'll have an album again. But I think that it will take a while, because we are very critical about everything.</p><p>Leyya's album <i>Sauna</i> is available now to download.</p>",

      "html": "<p>The Sherlocks are a four-piece indie rock band from Sheffield made up of two sets of brothers: Kiaran and Brandon Crook, and Andy and Josh Davidson. I was lucky enough to catch them at the Liquid Rooms in Edinburgh, on their UK tour leg.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/Yw9JRRhizm.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>When I arrive at the venue, the standing pit is already three-quarters full, and the first out of three opening acts hasn’t even begun. This signals to me that though relatively new, the fan base for the Sherlocks are a dedicated bunch. When the lights dim and the four bounce on stage, beginning their set with ‘Last Night’, I see this in action with hands beginning to frantically wave, screaming girls and much to my surprise a (rowdy!) mosh pit forming. When I interviewed the band backstage, they were very laid back, so it’ surprising when the music begins and the band-members all explode with enthusiasm at the crowd’s response.</p><p>As the set continues, the feel-good, fast-paced music continues, with strong rhythms from bassist Andy Davidson (along with sips of his corona), and the synched rock-star jumps that him and his brother Josh, the guitarist, execute to theirs (and the crowd’s) amusement. Mid-way through the set, the music briefly settles down as the band transition into their acoustic set, full of great minor progressions, with hits ‘Will You Be There’ and ‘Candlelight’; a crowd favourite, especially when lead singer Kiaran Crook asks everyone to take out their phone flashlights. Although a bit of an Ed Sheeran move, the lights actually work in the small venue, and it’s clear that the crowd is loving it. The band reach their romantic ‘Heart of Gold’ which starts off slow but accelerates into a loud football chant led by the band.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHjujoZ1bF4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHjujoZ1bF4</a></p><p>This exciting beat sets the tone for a great finish to the set, as the crowd is re-energised (not that their energy has lulled at all). Through the song ‘Nobody Knows’ the intricacy of Brandon Crook’s drumming hits a high point with his impressive hard-hitting, groovy rhythms, highlighted by his much-deserved solos. As the song goes on, it is clear to see some of the band’s influences with Oasis-like riffs in the bridges (the band are going on tour with Liam Gallagher this month), which though similar to other indie-rock riffs, take a clear direction of their own.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gun47t0hFIY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gun47t0hFIY</a></p><p>The final two songs, ‘Live for the Moment’ and ‘Chasing Shadows’, the band’s biggest hits, round up the gig, with the audience erupting in chants. It’s great to see the band vibing off the audience, as the interaction between them becomes noticeably more playful. This night has showed off the Sherlocks’ music: an array of upbeat songs made up of indie-rock guitar chords and romantic lyrics, with a rough edge. As the set comes to an end, both the band and the crowd are sweaty and panting; signs of a good night.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/seVI1iqP3n.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Catch the Sherlocks on Liam Gallagher’s European tour (<a href=\"http://liamgallagher.com/tour\">http://liamgallagher.com/tour</a> ) or at various festivals over the summer (<a href=\"http://www.thesherlocksmusic.co.uk/#tour\">http://www.thesherlocksmusic.co.uk/#tour</a> )</p><p>You can listen to their debut album <i>Live For The Moment </i>on Spotify: (<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4SrofCfzlhtiKRAsMfBxV4\">https://open.spotify.com/artist/4SrofCfzlhtiKRAsMfBxV4</a> ) and iTunes (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-sherlocks/531251807\">https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-sherlocks/531251807</a> )</p><p>If you want to know more, head to their website for all social medias, merch and tour info! <a href=\"http://www.thesherlocksmusic.co.uk/#tour\">http://www.thesherlocksmusic.co.uk/#tour</a></p><p>All photo credits go to Findlay Macdonald (<a href=\"http://thewideo.com/\">http://thewideo.com/</a>)</p><p>To hear more about The Sherlocks, click here for an interview with them before the show: <a href=\"https://freshair.org.uk/posts/a-sit-down-with-the-sherlocks\">https://freshair.org.uk/posts/a-sit-down-with-the-sherlocks</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/eb40zt8RuW.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure>",

      "title": "A Sit-Down With The Sherlocks",
      "html": "<p>Since rising to fame, the Sherlocks have taken their traditional indie rock ban to great heights. Their debut album <i>Live For The Moment</i> (2017) entered the official UK charts at #6, they’ve opened for Kings of Leon and have gained much praise from Radio DJs such as Annie Mac and Huw Stevens. Mid-way through their UK headline tour, I sat down with Kiaran, Brandon, Josh and Andy and at the Liquid Rooms in Edinburgh.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/wp9WqP08E5.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><b>Let’s start with the origins of the band - how and why did you start The Sherlocks?</b></p><p>Kiaran: I think we’d all agree that the band just started out of pure boredom. It’s not something we’ve always wanted to do, it just happened. Brandon and I are brothers, and when the other two brothers Josh and Andy moved into the same area, it was just a progression after that. After a million games of football we wanted something else to do. Brandon already owned a drum kit, I had an axe and we started messing around.</p><p><b>If you weren’t doing music what would your ideal job be?</b></p><p>Kiaran: A lumberjack</p><p><i>(The band shake their heads in unison and laugh)</i></p><p><b>Who are your musical influences and inspirations?</b></p><p>Josh: All the greats</p><p>Brandon: Elvis</p><p>Kiaran: Definitely Elvis</p><p>Andy: The king of rock and roll</p><p><b>Let’s talk song-writing. How do you split up the process, or do you all do it together?</b></p><p>Brandon: Kiaran writes the songs and that’s it – we all just pick it up.</p><p><b>Do you write the music or lyrics first?</b></p><p>Kiaran: The music because – it’s just what seems to happen. I play around on guitar, stumble</p><p>upon a nice chord progression and then add a melody to it. I roughly hum a tune with it, even if there are no lyrics, then try and think of some.</p><p><b>Where do you get the inspiration for your lyrics?</b></p><p>Andy: I’d say they’re quite personal.</p><p>Kiaran: I don’t know to be honest. The last few songs I’ve been writing which will obviously be going to a second album are probably less personal. The first album is probably a bit more personal; not like my top-secret stuff, but the second album is trying less hard on lyrics. I don’t think anyone really cares that much about lyrics, and I spend ages thrashing my head over some lyrics -  there’s plenty of songs where so long as it’s a good tune, I don’t think people worry about lyrics too much. I’ve been sat up crying over lyrics in the night <i>(laughs)</i>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY1YrJNyFXw\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY1YrJNyFXw</a></p><p><b>When writing songs do you have any recurring progressions or do you like doing different things?</b></p><p>Kiaran: Probably a mix. It’s nice to do some stuff we’ve already done just because we like doing it but then it’s good to try new things as well. I think there’s a lot of different stuff in the first album. I think that interests us a lot more than just writing the same song 12 times.</p><p><b>After performing live, how do you feel if a show has gone well?</b></p><p>Josh: I think when you know that everyone who came had a good time. I guess that’s quite easy to gauge.</p><p><b>So you have tons of festivals lined up for this summer; do you prefer performing at festivals or touring venues?</b></p><p>Josh: Touring - you’re in your own world, everything’s set up for you, done nicely, there’s not as many worries. Festivals are a lot more off the cuff with a different set up every day - a bit unpredictable.</p><p>Kiaran: Yeah I’d agree. Also, at your own gigs its 100% your fans who’ve come to see you, but I guess festivals are also good because you gain new fans – but a lot more can go wrong.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tue9DkOkAC8\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tue9DkOkAC8</a></p><p><b>You’re over halfway through your tour, how’s that going? Are there any memorable moments so far?</b></p><p>Kiaran: It wasn’t that funny but at the London gig our power went off at least twice. The speakers sounded like they were blowing up, and everything was off except our guitar amps at the back. Nothing was coming out of the speakers, and my mic wasn’t working so I couldn’t even speak to the crowd, so we just ended up doing a big sing-a-long at the Electric Ballroom in Camden.</p><p>Josh: It was a pretty nice moment actually.</p><p><b>If I was an alien coming to earth and you were the first band I ran into, how would you describe your music?</b></p><p>Kiaran: Space jazz.</p><p><b>Who are you listening to right now?</b></p><p>Kiaran: We just had a bit of Pearl Jam on, I’d never listened to them. We’d heard of them – they’re a lot heavier than what I’d thought…sounds good though.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/T0_FJKdqIT.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><b>If you could go on a dinner date with any musician dead or alive, who would it be?</b></p><p>Brandon and Andy: undoubtedly Elvis.</p><p>Kiaran: I’d go for the one who just died from the Cranberries – Dolores O’Riordan.</p><p>Josh: The lead singer of sleeper – I don’t know what her name is but I’d go for her.</p><p><b>To finish, what are your plans for the future?</b></p><p>Kiaran: We’re supporting Liam Gallagher on his European tour after this one, then we’re going all across America and Canada. After that it’s festival season, and I guess we’ll try and squeeze a bit of recording in there somewhere.</p><p>Andy: Try and write a few more bangers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/acn3hZFdMb.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Catch the Sherlocks on Liam Gallagher’s European tour (<a href=\"http://liamgallagher.com/tour\">http://liamgallagher.com/tour</a> ) or at various festivals over the summer (<a href=\"http://www.thesherlocksmusic.co.uk/#tour\">http://www.thesherlocksmusic.co.uk/#tour</a> )</p><p>You can listen to their debut album <i>Live For The Moment </i>on Spotify: (<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4SrofCfzlhtiKRAsMfBxV4\">https://open.spotify.com/artist/4SrofCfzlhtiKRAsMfBxV4</a> ) and iTunes (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-sherlocks/531251807\">https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-sherlocks/531251807</a> )</p><p>If you want to know more, head to their website for all social medias, merch and tour info! <a href=\"http://www.thesherlocksmusic.co.uk/#tour\">http://www.thesherlocksmusic.co.uk/#tour</a></p><p>All photo credits go to Findlay Macdonald (<a href=\"http://thewideo.com/the-sherlocks-live-review/\">http://thewideo.com/the-sherlocks-live-review/</a>)</p><p>For a full review of The Sherlocks' performance, click here: <a href=\"https://freshair.org.uk/posts/the-sherlocks-at-the-liquid-rooms-edinburgh\">FreshAir.org.uk &gt; The Sherlocks at The Liquid Rooms, Edinburgh</a></p>",

The album takes the form of a narrative in which Marling's alterego, named 'Rosie', bitterly shuns naivety and love, before reappropriating them and finding some peace and resolution. It is an ambitious 16-track song cycle that is heavily inspired by folk stalwarts like Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and Leonard Cohen. However, it also takes its place alongside records by those icons in the pantheon of great singer-songwriter confessionals, and Marling's influence can already be felt in the work of emergent folk artists.</p><p>Listen back to the show here: https://soundcloud.com/louis-norman/long-player-ep1-once-i-was-an-eagle</p><p>This week's playlist:</p><ul><li>'Suzanne', Leonard Cohen</li><li>'<strong>I Was an Eagle</strong>', Laura Marling</li><li>'Jim Cain', Bill Callahan</li><li>'California', Joni Mitchell</li><li>'<strong>Pray for Me</strong>', Laura Marling</li><li>'Tangled Up In Blue', Bob Dylan</li><li>'Natural Blue', Julie Byrne</li><li>'<strong>Saved These Words</strong>', Laura Marling</li><li>'Los Ageless', St. Vincent</li></ul>",

It was a shame that the weaknesses that would mar this otherwise outstanding production reared their heads so early on. Nonetheless it would be mistake not to try and catch the final performance of this production, directed by Joe Christie, at Bedlam Theatre.</p><p>The set, designed by Iona Tangri, was the standout feature of the production. It made use of every inch of the Bedlam Theatre stage, making it appear much larger than it really is. The attention to detail was unrivalled, from the wallpaper and mounted wall lights to the wear in the chicken wire, piles of dirt on the stage and the clutter on the work surface, lending the production a much more professional appearance than most student theatre can expect attain. The costume was also totally coherent and true to the setting, thanks to the efforts of designer Laura Hounsell.</p><p>This was complimented by some fantastic tech, comprising of sound design by Huw Jones and lighting by Elissa Webb. It was a rare instance of sound being employed effectively in theatre to create atmosphere under the dialogue, although on more than one instance the dialogue was drowned out, although this was likely only a first night slip-up just like the occasional overly abrupt cuts like the one at the beginning of the play.</p><p>The script, translated from Bouchard’s original Quebec French, is beautifully balanced between moments of intense emotion and bittersweet humour which was largely carried by Davies in the role of Tom, the ad executive from the Big City. Despite his initial hesitancy, he warmed into the role throughout the play, switching nicely from Tom’s childlike internal dialogue to his loaded exchanges with the other characters. More, perhaps, could have been made of this element of the script, occasionally Davies’ pace meant that the change of mood was lost. The development of his relationship with Agatha, the bereaved mother of his lover, was particularly moving. Tilly Botsford, playing Agatha, was deeply empathetic.</p><p>There was a certain separation between the character of Francis as implied by script and the performance given by Peter Morrison; Bouchard’s writing evoked an ignorantly bitter young man, left behind in the fringes of society, not only by his own brother but by the fast- advancing world as well. Morrison, although an energetic and committed actor, never quite manages to convincingly convey the monstrous anger living inside Francis.</p><p>Christie should be proud of this feat of a production that would undoubtedly have merited five stars if it had been afforded a little extra time to mature and sharpen up.</p>",

The song seems to be about being a young person and experiencing real-life issues which are mediated (and even blunted) by social media- “If I see your father’s ghost, I’ll screenshot the post”- and where new experiences and opinions are hatched online- “My feed is telling me it’s safe to take ecstasy / If Bernie says it’s so, I’ll move to the States and vote”.</p><p>Answering the question “are you alright?” is a difficult thing to do truthfully, but Yenkee does just that in a way which is also relevant to being a young person on the Internet in 2018.</p><p>“Are You Alright?” is available on Bandcamp, and for streaming on Spotify.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/Uzo9P-udXA.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>In 2009, Rafe Offer and Rocky Start went to a music festival and were disappointed to find a lot of the audience more focused on the social scene rather than the music. This frustration inspired them to host their own gig in a friend’s North London flat for just a handful of people. This went so well that they decided to host more. Word gradually spread about their low-key shows, and now Sofar Sounds operates in over 300 cities across the world. Little did they know that their first gathering would grow into a global movement to connect strangers through a shared love of live music.</p><p>There are a few things that make the Sofar Sounds gigs different from your typical concert. Firstly, you often have to apply to get a spot. Sofar Sounds expects its audience to be respectful, so no texting or talking during the performances, and, most importantly, each attendee should love music. The other distinct feature of Sofar Sounds gigs is that they label themselves as secret. While the Sofar Sounds name is anything but a secret, the locations of their events are generally released 24 hours or less before the gigs and the performers are only made known just as they are about to perform. They are also known to host both extremely and less well-known performers, so you never know what you’re going to get. All that is certain is that the music selection will be well curated, and you’ll have a relaxed and respectful concert atmosphere.</p><p>On Thursday, January 25, I am one of the lucky ones with a spot at the Edinburgh Sofar Sounds gig. The evening before the show, I receive an email with the time and location, which this time was the Traverse Theatre. Sofar Sounds is known to host in eclectic venues, such as living rooms, churches, and shops, so I am little bummed that this show is in a more generic venue, but am nonetheless still excited for the mystery performers. I arrive and shortly after am led with the group to the Traverse Bar Café. As customary for Sofar Sounds shows, I plop myself on the floor towards the front of the room. I am surrounded by an audience of no one type, which I feel fits in line with the inclusive and warm image of Sofar Sounds. During the introductions, the local organisers outline the rules and ask us to hug our neighbors. Considering I am a solo attendee, I feel a bit uncomfortable about this suggestion as I observe many pairs of friends hugging each other all around me. I then look to the right and notice another female solo attendee. We look at each other for an awkward moment, shrug, and then share a nice hug. This is the kind of warm and quirky atmosphere that Sofar Sounds creates.</p><p>The first performers are the American duo Delightful Squalor, which consists of Lake Montgomery and Cera Impala. They announce that they only began performing together about a year ago, but you could not tell as their melodies melt together effortlessly. They take elements of blues, gospel, folk, and jazz and entrance the audience with their soothing sounds. A highlight was their song ‘Molasses,’ where Delightful Squalor’s harmonies and lyrics transport you to a balmy summer afternoon. The second act of the evening is the Edinburgh-based indie duo Milkd. While the vocals are not quite as captivating as Delightful Squalor’s, Milkd offers charming lyrics and lulling instrumentals. Released in November, their most catchy tune ‘Come Out’ brings the audience most to life with many people bopping their heads and swaying to the irresistible feel of the chorus. Next up is the Glaswegian group Static Union. Some of their music embodies a more classic alt-rock sound, while other songs, such as ‘Last Resort,’ create a more nostalgic and dreamy feel with underlying synth sounds. The young Scottish four-piece group has a strong stage presence and a cool sound, and I can definitely see them making a bigger name for themselves in the near future. The last group of the night is a West Lothian-based indie rock group called The Phantoms. You can definitely feel that they are the most seasoned performers of the bunch with their confidence performing and engaging the audience, but they lack a bit of the charm I felt with the other more recently established groups. Overall, Sofar Sounds does what it is known to do by delivering a wonderful selection of live performers in a truly warm, respectful, and intimate space.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/wzt77G_Uw4.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Bad Sounds are a groove-based, hip-hop inspired 5-piece band from Bath. Since forming, their single <i>Avalanche </i>has been hailed ‘Best Record in the World’ by Annie Mac, they’ve performed at Glastonbury and Bestival, and were shortlisted for MTV’s ‘Brand New’ competition in 2017. I was lucky enough to catch up with brothers Ewan and Callum Merrett at the Barrowland Ballroom in Glasgow, before their debut show supporting Rat Boy on their <i>Civil Disorder </i>tour<i>. </i></p><p><b>Let’s start with the origins of the band – when and why did you decide to start Bad Sounds?</b></p><ul><li>Ewan - me and Cal are brothers and we used to play in bands when we were kids. Cal moved away to London and Bristol, and got into recording bands and learning how a studio works, while I got more into hip hop and sample based stuff. We were doing separate stuff for a while, but after moving back we were both in the same house again so we thought we’d try something out. We really liked what we did – what we were doing separately felt generic, but coming together we found a better direction.</li><li>Callum - It was exciting working that way because we were learning things off each other, whereas before we were just in the same place as guitarists.</li></ul><p><b>You’ve been compared to artists like Beck numerous times, along with being associated with an indie-funk style – who do you consider to be the biggest influences for your music?</b></p><ul><li>E – not indie funk, that’s a term that destroys me! Haha no it’s fine… I don’t know - I feel like we’re more into albums than artists:  Demon Days by the Gorillaz is a massive influence on me, as well as Midnight Marauders by a Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. I find it hard to put my finger on why I like an album – there’s good stuff in everything.</li><li>C – I like Paul’s Boutique by the Beastie Boys. That was produced by the same guys who did Odelay by Beck, another great album. That production duo had the biggest impact on the overall way that we think about constructing a song and our production technique. They use really cool breaks and don’t seem to worry about chopping songs straight into each other. They make the music seem like it’s fluid which I really like.</li></ul><p><b>Why the qualm with Indie Funk?</b></p><ul><li>E - I think for me, I never considered myself into indie music. I like funk music like James Brown and Sly and the Family Stone but ‘Indie Funk’ makes me think of every worst band at a festival ever. I don’t really have any qualms with ‘Indie Funk’ - I feel it comes out really bad if we’re like DON’T CALL US INDIE FUNK!</li><li>C – I think it’s just that if someone had never heard us and then someone described us as indie funk, I don’t really feel like that’s the best introduction to our sound. When I think about the influences we just talked about, there’s definitely a lot of groove based stuff and we definitely have a DIY approach to certain things which I guess the indie thing would come into, but we’ve never really related to the indie scene. The thing is, we seem to have been taken under its wing which is a really nice compliment to be honest.</li></ul><p><b>You’ve said in the past that a lot of your lyrics come from conversations you’ve had with friends. Is there a favourite memory that you associate with any of your songs?</b></p><ul><li>C – I really like the Julie story, because I don’t really see her anymore. I used to work with her and she was just the loveliest character, so I think that every time we perform. When I get to sing that line I always think about her, and it’s just nice for me.</li><li>E –I don’t have a favourite, but the line about the dog tattoo has become more of a thing than I ever thought it was going to, especially because I’ve never spoken to the person about it. I’m always worried she’s going to read it in an interview or hear somewhere that the line was about her and be like ‘<i>alright, this guy’s a bit mental!’</i></li></ul><p><b>Talking about gigs, what’s been the most inspirational gig you’ve been to?</b></p><ul><li>E – I wouldn’t say so much in terms of stage presence and stuff like that, but before we saw The Flaming Lips, I never really liked live gigs. It was the first time I’d seen an artist put on a proper show – a gig could be fun and you’d go home having actually enjoyed yourself and not just watched four moody people. We also saw De La Soul in Bristol, and they properly threw a party which was really cool. But yeah, I really liked the idea that it could be a fun night and not just bands playing their songs.</li></ul><p><b>What kind of stuff are you listening to right now?</b></p><ul><li>C – I feel like people will get the wrong idea if I say, but I listen to a lot of jazz and new jazz hip-hop hybrid stuff. There’s a guy called Chris Dave who’s an insane drummer.  This guy plays live drums like J Dilla programmes them, which is really interesting. We grew up as guitarists, but as you get into sampling and hip-hop and making beats and stuff, you start paying a lot more attention to the drums.<b> </b></li><li>E – Me and Sam were just listening to some Dr. Dre…<b></b></li></ul><p><b>If you could have a dinner date with any musician, who would it be?</b></p><ul><li>C – QuestLove – he’s my idol. I love his passion for music and his enthusiasm for learning everything about music. I want his brain.</li><li>E – Timbaland because it would be amazing to watch him say the most awful things over and over again.</li></ul><p><b>To wrap up, can we expect a debut album anytime soon from you guys?</b></p><ul><li>C – I hope so! We’re working on it.</li></ul><p>Catch Bad Sounds at <i>Community </i>Festival this summer (<a href=\"https://communityfestival.london/)\">https://communityfestival.london/)</a> or on the remainder of Rat Boy’s <i>Civil Disorder </i>UK tour.

      "title": "Bad Sounds at Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow",
      "html": "<p>Bad Sounds are a 5-piece groove and hip-hop inspired band from Bath and Bristol. Having toured with Rat Boy in 2016, they’re back together for the <i>Civil Disorder </i>UK tour.</p><p>The crowd is full of (mainly) buzzing teenagers excited for what’s to come. Having just interviewed the charismatic brothers of the band, Ewan and Callum Merrett, it will be interesting to see if they can pull off the level of energy I’ve understood they want to achieve. Both brothers have made it clear to me that they want their show to not just consist of shoegazing musicians playing their songs, but like a “party” where the audience goes home inspired.</p><p>As the lights fade up and the audience screams, the band bounces onto stage and immediately begin playing ‘Hot Head Chippenham’, a track off their newest release, <i>Mixtape One – EP, </i>released in September. Ewan and Callum quickly establish themselves as the frontmen of the band through their enthusiastic jumping around and beckoning the crowd to sing along. Before the show, Callum told me that he was excited for the challenge of winning over an audience not necessarily there to see Bad Sounds, and now it’s clear to see from the grinning audience and multitude of phones keen to film the set that they’ve succeeded. It’s hard to resist the full-sound produced by all five members of the band, highlighted by the in-sync movement of the two brothers zoning in on their akai beat machines.</p><p>As the band launch into their next hit ‘Zacharia’, guitarist Charlie Pitt and bassist Sam Hunt begin to up their dance-factor, after Charlie announces that he’s always wanted to play Barrowland. The hits keep coming with “Are You High” and the ever-increasing levels of enthusiasm, play-wrestling and interaction keep everyone keenly engaged. As the show goes on, tambourines are cracked out and the band members vibe with each other, undoubtedly surprised by the audience that forms a !MOSH PIT! As the crowd bobs their heads in sync to ‘Avalanche’, a song hailed as ‘This Week’s Best Album in the World’ by Radio 1’s Annie Mac, each of the individual musical personalities begin to shine; noticeably the strong beats coming from drummer Olivia Dimery. What’s so enjoyable about the performance is the obvious contribution from each member – the drum, bass, individual guitars and sound effects produced are all clearly distinguishable from each other yet mesh together in such a way that they produce a crisp, edgy and layered sound, helped by the great acoustics of the room.</p><p>Every great show must come to an end, but with Bad Sounds, the catchy guitar riffs (highlighting the band’s love of sampling) continue, as they move into their biggest hit ‘Wages’ as the finale. As the trumpets sound and the feel-good vibes radiate in the crowd, the brothers embrace on stage with huge grins on their faces. It’s clear that everyone’s had a great time.If a “party” was what the band was aiming for, it’s clear to see that this performance lived up to expectations. By no means did a group of sullen band members stand on stage idly playing their instruments – Bad Sounds gave their all, culminating in a performance to remember.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/wem_68Y3jd.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Catch Bad Sounds at Community Festival this summer, along with the remainder of Rat Boy’s <i>Civil Disorder </i>UK leg.

Lyrically, the songs are typical of romantic British folk but occasionally they break from this more traditional style (delivered with Gatrill’s goosebump-inducing voice) to delve into layered instrumentals.The two musicians almost seem to be improvising, bouncing sounds back and forth and reacting instantly to what the other is playing.</p><p>The odd intermission between songs allows for jokes, and friendly chat with the audience and Emma Gatrill even hand-delivers a postcard to someone in the crowd (sent by an audience member at a previous show). Watching Gatrill and Hamblett perform is like being amongst friends -albeit incredibly talented ones- and this relaxed atmosphere continues for the rest of the evening.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/J3u-vJqpbr.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>A blind drawing of Hamish Hawk.</p><p>Hamish (“as in Hamish”) Hawk (“as in the bird of prey”), the second act of the night, is best described as the kind of person that mums love. While his sweet one-man-one-guitar tunes initially come off as hokey, his charm onstage -not limited to between-song banter- becomes endearing. He shares stories about dreams in which he gets sushi with Graham Norton, and while performing he smiles and nods to audience members. He seems to have fun onstage by himself, which is in turn generously reciprocated by the audience.</p><p>Kate Stables and company reach the stage, and immediately launch into their set with “Two Pence Piece”, from This is the Kit’s latest album Moonshine Freeze. In an interview, Kate Stables has said that with this latest record, it’s hard to know what to take the credit for, as it has been such a collaborative effort. This collaboration is evident particularly with “Two Pence Piece”, in the vocal harmonies provided by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qevANBIKxAo\">Rozi Plain</a>, Kate’s friend and a successful musician in her own right, and in the percussive effects added by This is the Kit touring regulars, Neil Smith and Jamie Whitby-Coles. Emma Gatrill and Marcus Hamblett return as the horn section which adds incredible depth to the sound produced by a band of just four members.</p><p>Their set varies from songs like ‘Nits’, a track from the 2015 album Bashed Out which is banjo-based, but punctuated with Sufjan Stevens-esque horns, to ‘Moonshine Freeze’ the latest album’s title track. The performance of ‘Moonshine Freeze’ in particular demonstrates the benefits of the band being on a “neverending tour”. It is tight, well-rehearsed (not to mention performed by musicians of astounding talent) and is met with audible delight from the crowd. It is clear why Aaron Dessner and Guy Garvey are This is the Kit fans- occasionally songs are in some way reminiscent of both The National and Elbow.</p><p>Nothing is lost in the transition from record to live show. The sound of the 7-piece group is full and clear, with the bonus of being able to witness in person the fun that each member has as they interact with one another. The feeling of being amongst friends is encouraged by the fact that the musicians are indeed all friends, to which Kate remarks “I’m feeling very spoiled”.</p><p>Towards the end of the show, all musicians but Kate take a seat on stage. They soak up the heat from the spotlights (in what is an admittedly very cold theatre- ‘Cold and Got Colder’ is later dedicated to the audience) and Kate performs a cover of “Gone Again” by Morning Star. The lullaby-like song signals the end of the set, as when Kate finishes, the rest of the band rejoin her for the final song and well-anticipated encore.</p><p>The show’s lowkey grand finale comes in the form of the title track from Bashed Out. The National-like guitar and horn sounds combined with shimmering drums echo in the theatre and at the end, the band are visibly delighted by the energetic applause from the crowd.</p><p>In our interview, Kate Stables said that she has been touring for over a decade. When touring is your full-time job, you tend to get quite good at it. This is the Kit are definitely good at it.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/g9imNVE-Pw.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><i>The 2018 Banff film festival was notable, as always, for showcasing some of the worlds most talented and inspirational mountain adventurers -not least the hilarious film about incredibly accomplished paraclimber Maureen Beck.</i></p><p>Undisputed as the world’s greatest film festival, having started in 1976 by local climbers and skiers looking for some off-season excitement, this year was no different. The festival tours 600 countries, having showings on all seven continents.</p><p>The showing in Edinburgh this year took place on Saturday the 13th of January. In the festival theatre a crowd assembled, complexions glowing and sinews straining from aspirational training, gore text jackets for all-weathers, pertex puffas for ice climbing, and spandex blended jeans for rock climbing. Energy bars were dished out from the sponsors along with groovy outdoor lifestyle stickers for estate car roof boxes. Let the Banff Mountain Film Festival begin.</p><p>First up ‘Imagination’, a film featuring Tom Wallisch a professional freeskier, runs on the premise of a little boy’s imagination of ski stunts in the surrounding landscape as he’s driven to school by his parents. The parents sit in the front arguing and discussing bathroom tiles at length, whilst the boy dreams of a freestyle skier outside the car and hey presto Tom Wallisch is leaping and spinning from house to house, trashing his skis clearing roads and railings. As the family reach the school Tom Wallisch is joined by countless skiers from the imaginations of the other children. The short film is endearing and humorous with some beautiful shots of Nelson, BC, Canada, it won ‘Best Snowsports Film’ in the festival.</p><p>Next up we see ‘Edges’ a film about the life of Yvonne Dowlen a 90-year old world class ice skater. Yvonne, who walks with difficulty manages to hold grace and agility once on the ice, she claims skating is easier than walking for her. She tells the camera that we need not abandon our passions, hobbies and pastimes as we get older and as if to prove the point as the film ends there is a postscript saying, “She died as she lived, on the ice -2016”. A collective emotional swallowing throughout the audience.</p><p>Following this emotional clip is a film, ‘Intersection’, about a mountain biker/artist, Micayla Gatto, who combines her passion for mountain landscapes through her two jobs.  The film is a supremo, its fast, its furious, its five minutes with riffy rock guitars and badass drums. The landscapes and their pictorial paintings are stunning.</p><p>The next film, a cracking one, ‘Into Twin Galaxies’, follows the National Geographic Adventurers of the year Ben Stookesberry, Sarah McNair-Landry and Erik Boomer as they travel across Greenland by foot, ski, kite ski and kayak. The trio adored in very attractive outdoor clothing embark on a 1000km trip to reach the northern-most un-kayaked river. Well it’s not without hitch, the trio have relied on google earth for an assessment of the terrain. They start off dragging their kayaks across glacier crevasses which takes days and days. Then the ice smooth’s out, the wind picks up and they kite surf along at pace, until Sarah is lifted into the air and falls hurting her back (we find out later she has broken it but didn’t realise until back home). They press on in an all for one and one for all style, eventually getting to the lake which the river runs from and finding the river completely frozen. This is terrible news however, they find the river is melted downstream though fast and furious. The advnturers decide to do some white water kayaking down some improbably fast and narrow waterfalls. They complete the task, terrify the audience and Ben emerges from the torrent of water with only a bashed nose. Ben and Sarah hug. Erik says he wouldn’t do it again and the audience love it. The festival takes a break for some mountain themed prizes and so the audience of budding mountaineers can stock up on necessary protein bars and hydration.</p><p>The films resume, first for this half is ‘Frozen Road’ a solo -30°C bike trip filmed entirely by the cyclist Ben Page as he crosses Canada to the Arctic sea. The trip, inspired by author Jack London quotes about manliness and solitude, it almost comes across as machoistic. Ben gets very, very cold, his isolation reaches climax with his fear of being eaten by wolves. They howl while he lies in his cold dark tent. Eventually Ben is rescued by some locals in a snow storm, armed with rifles for the wolves and a body stretcher for the presumed dead Ben.</p><p>By far the highlight of this year’s festival was the hilarious ‘Stumped’. Maureen Beck is missing her low left arm, she starts the film telling us a list of possible incidents that could have resulted in this. Already we’re warmed by her humour and how she obviously doesn’t take herself too seriously. By far the best is “don’t wave to people when jumping from a helicopter”. Maureen is also a pretty good rock climber who sets herself the target of climbing a grade 5.12 climb, which any climbers will know is no easy task, Maureen has over 50 attempts, the film makers engineer a surprise cameo appearance by rock god Tommy Caldwell, who with his left arm tied up attempts the climb and fails on the crux move which is blocking Maureen’s ascent. Its back to basics time and Maureen embarks on a healthy eating and cardio exercise regimen. The film ends with Maureen finally making it but not before the film sound cut out. When she makes the climb and audience member yells “give her a cupcake” a reference to Maureen’s cupcake addiction, testimony to how engaged the audience are with her character. This film is funny and beautifully shot, emphasising that paraclimbers like Maureen do not want to be told what they do is inspirational for a disabled person, they want their deserved respect as international climbing champions pushing the boundaries of what’s conceivable.</p><p>This year the films were extraordinary pushing both the boundaries of adventure sports, unexplored regions and tackling issues of disability, gender and ageism. The film festival managed to get a cross selection of varied pursuits each presented in different film styles. A common factor was the astonishing ability of these individuals in their chosen discipline. I look forward to next year’s selection and encourage you to watch these films, especially ‘Into Twin Galaxies’ and ‘Stumped’.</p>",

      "title": "A Chat With Pumarosa",
      "html": "<p>On the 1<sup>st</sup> December Pumarosa played at King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow.  A five-piece band coming from East London, their music has been called “industrial spiritual”.  Exactly what that means I’m not sure, but if you haven’t heard them yet and like rocky/electronic music with lots of jamming then definitely give them a listen.  I chatted to drummer Nick Owen to find out more about the band…</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/90XiO5K7Hz.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><b>FreshAir.org.uk: Where did you guys get your name from?</b></p><p>Nick: It was quite a long process as we were trying to find a name that wasn’t taken - there’s always a band in New Zealand or Australia that had the one we wanted.  Then Isabel used to be in a band called Mini Puma so that’s where the puma bit came from and then Rosa was a kind of composite word and then we found out that a ‘pumarosa’ was a fruit.</p><p><b>FA:  Really! Have you tried it?</b></p><p>Nick: No.  It grows in South America so maybe one day we’ll try it but they look cool and it’s kind of nice being named after a fruit I suppose.</p><p><b>FA: Who have been your biggest musical influences?</b></p><p>Nick:  As a band I suppose there’s a huge list, not that we sound like any of them but there’s stuff that we all enjoy and have been inspired by.  Nick Cave and a lot of electronic stuff like Aphex Twin and Radiohead.</p><p><b>FA: It might have been one you’ve already mentioned but if you could record a song with any band or artist who would you pick?</b></p><p>Nick:  Maybe it would be good to do something really unlikely - like an electronic collaboration with - actually no that would be horrible! I was going to say with Nick Drake but that would probably not be worth it but I’m going to go with it anyway.</p><p><b>FA:  Are there any hobbies or things that don’t directly contribute to your music that you feel influences it in any way?</b></p><p>Nick: Jamie and Tomoya are constantly in production, Jamie has a studio and is constantly researching and Tomoya does loads of improvisation nights and jazz.  That’s all music based still though.  Isabel paints and is a visual artist as well.  I also make woodworking stuff.  I don’t know why that kind of stuff seems to be quite prevalent with drummers.</p><p><b>FA:  Maybe it’s because of the sticks?</b></p><p>Nick:  Yeah!  It could literally be as simple as that it’s the sticks.</p><p><b>FA:  What’s the best thing you’ve ever made?</b></p><p>Nick: [pause] Well I built a house once.</p><p><b>FA:  What song are you most enjoying performing on this tour?</b></p><p>Nick:  I mean they come and go.  We’re playing some songs off the album that we haven’t been touring earlier in the year so they’re fresher and newer – ‘Hollywood’ and ‘Barefoot’ from the album <i>The Witch</i>.  ‘Snake’ is really fun, it’s probably my favourite because it’s psychedelic, crazy: really energy based.  It’s easy for me because it’s just the same thing all the way through for about seven minutes so I can just really get into it.  No matter how good or bad a gig is going that one is always quite strong.</p><p><b>FA:  Are there any new/upcoming bands or artists that you particularly admire?</b></p><p>Nick:  Yeah I haven’t actually heard them yet but I hear people raving about a band in South London called Black Midi and then also from South London – Shame – who are really good, they’ve just released their first album.  I have a few friends who are in really great bands like Sweat, again, from South London – they all seem to be from South London!<b></b></p><p><b>FA:  Do you have any advice for any aspiring musicians?</b></p><p>Nick: Technologically there are just so many angles now and there’s people who travel and play at stadiums from a laptop and there are other bands slugging around drums and then there’s any number of infusions between the two so I suppose just try out as much as you can.  I think making music that allows you to be fluid and in the moment when you’re performing live is the goal.  Maybe anything you have to pay attention to is annoying, that’s what I’m finding anyway.  That’s weird advice.  I don’t even know if that <i>is</i> advice!</p><p><b>FA:  What’s the best gig you’ve ever been to?</b></p><p>Nick:  Well I saw Nick Cave and that was incredible, he’s such an amazing performer.  Patti Smith I’ve seen who’s also incredible.  We saw Massive Attack as well and the sound design was phenomenal.  That was at Glastonbury.</p><p><b>FA: Finally, if you had to describe yourself in three words what would they be?</b></p><p>Nick:  Oh god.  Amorphous, small and…it’s so difficult!  I’ve got all day mate I’m going to be here all day…fff…</p><p><b>FA:  Were you going to say funny?</b></p><p>Nick:  I think you’ve said it, you’ve said it.</p><p>After travelling round the UK, Pumarosa will venture all around Europe on their tour, from Italy to Spain, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, and finally France.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/jMynL6LdqT.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Alex Cameron is on the cusp of becoming a household name. Not that he doesn’t already have the look, moves or talent of a rock’n’roll heavyweight, but rather he comes across as a man of the people despite the fact that his schtick is pretending to be a lecherous hack. Here, in Glasgow’s Mono, the intimate vegan cafe-cum-venue, he is about to serve up a platter of synth-driven pop with a healthy portion of dad dancing. He doesn’t shy away from interacting with the crowd- even before the show. He works his way from the green room to the stage, hugging friends and shaking hands.</p><p>Part of Alex Cameron’s charm is his washed-up Hollywood entertainer bit. <em>Forced Witness</em>, his latest album, is artfully sleazy. This sleaze is revealed throughout the show by the band, who happen to look as if they have all stumbled out of a casino that night. Fan-favourite Roy Molloy is on saxophone and indie-pop chanteuse Holiday Sidewinder provides backing synth. As the show opens with ‘Happy Ending’ from Cameron’s 2013 debut, <em>Jumping the Shark</em>, Roy, Holiday and the rest of the band bop along disaffectedly to the pared back synth and drum beat.</p><p>As disaffected as the backing band appear, Alex Cameron can’t contain his excitement. He busts moves during each song, threading the mic’s cable through his hands and adopting a rock’n’roll stance. Noting the sizeable crowd, he says “we used to play to 5 or 6 people in a basement, so this is a beautiful thing”.</p><p>The enthusiasm shown by the crowd is reciprocated by the band. In an ongoing meme for this tour, Roy rates the footstool he is given by the venue (3.5/5). Introducing the song ‘Candy May’, Cameron says “I wrote this song as a love song and I played it to the girl it’s for and she started crying, and I realised it’s a breakup song” and the crowd laughs.</p><p>The song, ‘Real Bad Looking’, sounds like telephone hold music with a darker side to the lyrics. Sung from two perspectives- a woman and a man, at the same bar- their personalities are betrayed by lines like “I am the goddamn drunkest, ugliest girl at the bar/ Yeah who the hell are you to tell me that I can't leave my kid in the car”.</p><p>On-stage Alex Cameron comes across as likeable, even as he dons detestable characters through song. Although fans know that Cameron’s persona is just a character, it appears problematic in how quick the audience is to join in and sing along- particularly with ‘Marlon Brando’ in which the song’s cowardly protagonist says “So I'll tell you something sister, I'm feeling mighty fine / You tell that little faggot call me faggot one more time”.</p><p>This particular song, however, comes with a disclaimer from Cameron. He ensures that everyone is aware that the “confused straight white male” character is just a character, saying “as long as everyone is staying hydrated and being respectful, then we’re satisfied’.</p><p>Highlights of the show include a more upbeat ‘Strangers Kiss’, Roy’s saxophone solo in ‘Running Out of Luck’ (which met significant cheers from the crowd), and ‘The Chihuaha’, an electro-pop bop similar in sound to bands like Hot Chip and Metronomy.</p><p>Alex Cameron and band know how to please their audience and if they continue this trajectory of increasing popularity, it won’t be long before these Australians are back in the UK playing to even bigger crowds and rating even better footstools.</p>",

      "title": "'Blue Stockings' at Bedlam Theatre",
      "html": "<p>It takes a lot of bravery to see a play at Bedlam in winter, but Edinburgh University Theatre Company’s production of Jessica Swale’s Blue Stockings was worth sitting through the cold.</p><p>The play tells the story of some of the first female students at Girton College, Cambridge in the 1896, the misogyny and backlash they faced for choosing to study and their fight to be allowed to graduate with a degree.</p><p>The opening scene juxtaposes Girton principal Elizabeth Welsh addressing her new students on their first day of term with Dr Maudsley, author of ‘Sex in Mind and in Education’, giving a speech on the physical dangers of educating women. It’s a very powerful illustration of the rhetoric these pioneering women were contending with. It is absurd to the point of comedy that women were denied an education in case it interfered with their ability to have children, but as the story of these girls unfolds it’s obvious that it was no laughing matter.</p><p>We are introduced to the girls, Tess, Carolyn, Celia and Maeve on their first day at Girton. They are thrilled to be given the opportunity of an education, but aware of the prejudices that they will face. As part of their first science lesson, their teacher Mr Banks (Callum Pope) teaches them to ride a bicycle. The male students don’t believe their friend Edwards who claims to have seen a woman on a bike, saying it’s impossible as women ‘aren’t allowed’. Shockingly restrictive as this is, this is the boys’ attitude towards the presence of women at Cambridge and their amusement turns to more violent resistance as the play goes on. Ed Campbell really shone as Edwards, the fall guy of the boys group. His comic timing was perfect, and he was quietly hilarious without overdoing it.</p><p>As they begin their classes, they are met with enthusiasm from some teachers. Miss Blake (Heather Daniell), is passionate about fighting for the girls’ right to graduate and for the suffrage movement. She inspires the girls and pushes them to match their male counterparts grade for grade. Ultimately, their support for the girls costs both Miss Blake and Mr Banks their careers, such was the strength of feeling against them.</p><p>Each scene was titled, the titles appearing on a screen above the stage between scenes. This made the play seem like a series of vignettes, which worked well. It seemed natural to be dropping in on these characters at various points over the course of their year. However, the scene changes were often slow, and this made the run time of over two hours a little hard to bear in Bedlam’s less than ambient temperatures.</p><p>Blue Stockings confronts the audience with issues which in the UK today seem laughable. This production manages to find the humour in the situation. The comic moments are excellently played, but don’t take away from the gravity of the fight of these women and their allies.</p>",

      "title": "The Tin Soldier - A Perfect Christmas Theatre Treat for the Whole Family",
      "html": "<p>The Tin Soldier by the Birds of Paradise Theatre Company is an exciting, unpredictable, very entertaining but also critical play. It was obviously based on the romantic fairy tail by Hans Christian Andersen, which focuses on several dolls and other toys in the possession of a young, fortunate and rich boy. Specifically, it is the story about a steadfast tin soldier with only one leg. He is in love with a beautiful ballerina who is only standing on one leg as she is in a constant dancing pose. Therefore, the tin soldier thinks that the ballerina is just like him, incomplete, out of the norm. On day this soldier gets thrown away by the boy and has a long journey ahead of him while trying to find a way back to his true love.</p><p>The Birds of Paradise Theatre Company took Andersen’s original story and put it in a different setting told by a kid that is also an outsider due to a disability and who tells the story of the tin soldier while he is telling his own story of how he started liking this fairy tail although he used to hate it at first. So, this way the story is told by another outsider which is out of the norm, not completely accepted by society. A boy, who tells his own problems through the tin soldier as they reflect each other’s outsider positions, shortcomings and troubles.</p><p>In the play other social criticism is portrayed in a very well way for kids to understand but also touching and gripping for the grownups. All of this is put into a nice play with original music which is performed live. With and addition of sign language throughout the play so everyone can understand what is going on. Also, the whole text is portrayed on a screen during the show and, therefore, this piece can be heard, seen and read, experienced through several senses. This play includes not only a wider audience with this kind of performance but also wider range of actors. It is an integrative play which is performed by people from different backgrounds for people with all sorts of backgrounds.</p><p>The story is very gripping, sweet and sad. The actors play very well and it is definitely a show to be recommended to young and old as it is fun but also educating. Especially, perfect to watch during the holidays. It is heart-warming but also a reflection of our society and the problems that we face. And I think, if this would be the way we tell fairy tails and stories from now on, maybe, in the future we will deal with our problems better, and probably wouldn’t even have these problems. Because we would most likely try to work together more, include everyone to make a better future for all of us.</p><p>This performance can still be seen until Christmas at <strong><a href=\"http://www.edtheatres.com/studio\">The Studio</a>:</strong></p><p><strong>Thurs 7 - Sat 23 December, Evenings 7pm (not Sun or Mon) Matinees 2pm Thu 14, Fri 15, Wed 20, Thu 21, Fri 22 and Sat 23 December</strong></p><p>For details please see the official homepage: <u>http://www.edtheatres.com/thetinsoldier</u></p><p>And for more information about the Birds of Paradise Theatre Company have a look at: <u>http://www.boptheatre.co.uk/tin-soldier/</u></p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/BNsLNS4XIs.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>I eagerly anticipated Kllo’s show at Sneaky Pete’s on 28 November. Having been introduced to the band mere weeks ago, it seemed like fate that they were coming to Edinburgh. Kllo has been on a whirlwind international tour to promote their new album, <i>Backwater</i>.</p><p>To begin, since Sneaky Pete’s is a small, intimate venue, the cousin-duo of Kllo, Simon and Chloe, make their way from the back of the crowd to the stage to set up their equipment. We are given a few seconds of darkness before they begin their show with a performance of ‘Downfall.’</p><p>Simon is left in shadow manning the mixers while Chloe switches off between vocals and the pad controller. One neat aspect of the show is seeing them mix the music live. Their performance of ‘By Your Side’ highlights this. Chloe sings the first line “just wanna be by your side, again” and both proceed to mix the line with the rest of the instrumental on stage. This makes each show unique, and tailor-made for the audience. You get to witness the creation of the song right before your eyes.</p><p>Kllo then performs ‘Making Distractions,’ my favorite song off <i>Backwater</i>. Here, Chloe steps to the front of the stage to sing. She is silhouetted by the lights behind her and she feels so close to us. I am near the front and can almost see the shine of the whites of her eyes in the darkness. Combined with her breathy, ghostly vocals, it has a haunting, yet dreamlike effect.</p><p>Kllo breaks up the chilled-out vibe of the show with an absolute banger of performance of ‘Virtue.’ The lights, which have been relatively tame up until now, go up to full flashing lights. Simultaneously, the crowd which has been slightly swaying to the music, busts out into dance. It is the peak of the show.</p><p>The show concludes with more mellow performances of songs off <i>Backwater</i> and ‘Bolide,’ off <i>Well-Worn</i>. Considering the high energy performance of ‘Virtue’, this transition is rather jarring. This effect does not fully work and ends the show on a slightly unsatisfying note.</p><p>Despite this, the crowd is calling for an encore with “one more tune, one more tune.” A particularly bold crowd member calls for “three more tunes!” Chloe smiles, and sheepishly offers, “We’ve got a piano ballad for you. It’s one of our favorites. Would you like to hear it?” The crowd crows its approval and we are treated to a performance of ‘Nylon.’ The lights shut off then, and the show concludes.</p><p>Chloe and Simon hang around the venue after the show and I chat with them about their music and where they are headed next (Leeds). I tell Chloe that my friend compared her vocals with that of Little Dragon and she gives me a beaming smile. “I love Little Dragon. I love Yukimi. She is queen.” It is always reassuring when an artist you like is just as personable and enjoyable as their music. Fortunately, the show was just as enjoyable as well.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/swytq-oBCm.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Inimitable and intriguing, Aldous Harding is a woman of spellbinding stage-presence. She begins her show at Glasgow’s Art School backlit, bathed in blue light. Sitting alone onstage with just a guitar, she does nothing, says nothing, until the crowd finish clapping.</p><p>Her hour-long set begins with the final song from Party, her latest album. When sung in her low warbling contralto, the lyrics to ‘Swell Does the Skull’ sound as if they are in a different language. With exception is the line “I don’t want to be a sinner”, which rings out clearly through the venue, giving the song a sense of urgency, as if she is pleading with the audience.</p><p>A keyboard player comes onstage for the next song; ‘I’m So Sorry’. The piano adds little to the already bare-bones melody which is carried wholly by the power of Harding’s voice. She hugs the guitar close to her chest, her chin resting on its shoulder.</p><p>One of the most fascinating aspects of seeing Aldous Harding perform live is how she uses body language. Her face contorts with weird facial expressions, almost like she is trying to communicate the song’s emotion without language. She stares into the audience, nodding and grimacing and with eyes bulging like a boxer who is trying to psych out their opponent before a match. When she later sings ‘What If Birds Aren’t Singing They’re Screaming?’, her expressions paired with the unnerving lyrics- evoke the feeling that she is a malevolent narrator trying to frighten children.</p><p>Although she moves little during the beginning of the set, she stands for ‘Blend’ and again waits for the room to fall silent before beginning. She bobs along with the music, occasionally inserting arrhythmic dance movements, punctuated by small gestures that are not unlike a subdued version of Mick Jagger’s notorious strut.</p><p>She gradually works through a number of songs from Party and plays ‘Elation’- a new release- in which she eases the audience into the story with sweet vocals but then shocks them by bellowing the chorus. In some ways, Aldous Harding is a typical folk singer. Her songs are stories and poems, backed up by simple guitar melodies and her commanding voice but there remains something new and unnerving about her style of singing and performing.</p><p>It’s difficult to imagine Aldous Harding in a supermarket, or at home, or indeed any place other than the stage. Her theremin-like voice, which serenades us for her final song ‘Horizon’, almost makes us believe that she’s from another planet. This isn’t for lack of relatability- the lyrics to ‘Horizon’ speak about saying <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2017/05/19/529105358/the-story-of-aldous-hardings-party-track-by-track\">“Good-bye — and not necessarily for any reason at all other than... I've got to go. I'm showing that person two things; their life, and their life with me. And I'm taking one of them away. And that's me.”</a></p><p>With ‘Horizon’ she says goodbye to the audience, and we are left contemplating a life without her.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/x8XsFAlhlt.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Concerned about the state of the world? Go see Sylvan Esso. They manage to have a fantastic time and encourage the audience to do the same, all while acknowledging in their themes and lyrics that the world is not always an easy place to live. The experience overall was cathartic, leaving me feeling more positive about what music can do when there’s a connection between the band and the people who listen to them.</p><p>Sylvan Esso is made up of Nick Sanborn, a DJ and producer, and Amelia Meath, a vocalist who previously sang with the a capella folk group Mountain Man. The American duo came together in 2013 and are currently based out of Durham, North Carolina. The fact that they came from two different genres certainly influences their music. Amelia’s soulful lyrics and indie melodies pair terrifically with the restless electronic beats Nick creates.</p><p>The pair begins the night with the song “Sound”, the opener from their sophomore and most recent album, What Now. “Sound” starts out with a crackling sound, like a vinyl being put on a record player. The same verse repeats over and over again, going from a distorted hum to Amelia’s voice singing loud and clearly. It is not until this point that Amelia joins Nick onstage. Choosing this song, which is not characteristic of their generally spirited and energetic music, is a surprising but perfect choice that sets the tone for the rest of the show, mainly because it forces the buzzing crowd to quiet down and listen. It’s easy to just party and dance to Sylvan Esso’s music, but “Sound” reminds the audience that their songs have beautiful lyrics that deserve just as much attention as the high-powered rhythms.</p><p>That being said, Sylvan Esso’s live show is a party, and Nick and Amelia like it that way. Amelia spends most of the show sliding around on giant platform shoes that make her at least 6 inches taller than she actually is. During the instrumental breaks, she moves her body to the pulsing of the music, enjoying Nick’s performance just as much as the audience is. Her exuberant movement around the stage encourages her listeners to let go, have fun, and embrace the unique experience of seeing music live.</p><p>Sylvan Esso ends their performance with “Radio”, a biting sendup of the music industry that reminds me once again of how their songs can be entertaining while still carrying a progressive message. “Radio” is exactly three minutes and 30 seconds long, the length mainstream radio stations prefer, and comments on how hard it can be, for women especially, to break into the music industry. At the same time, it is Sylvan Esso’s most pop record, and it is the perfect danceable track to end the show on. Because at the end of the day, Nick and Amelia just want you to have the time of your life. I certainly did.</p>",

It’s been pretty much unbroken since then.</p><p><strong>AS: You haven’t stopped at all?</strong></p><p>Nick: Well, a few days here and there.</p><p>W: We started with the record shop gigs, ‘cause we wanted to make sure everyone knew that the physical was important to us, then we toured the UK as a headline and then we went round Europe - we’ve just got back - and now we’re doing this.</p><p><strong>AS: Do you get bored of playing any of your songs?</strong></p><p>Sam: <em>(immediately) </em>Yep. I’m already bored of playing all of them. I want some new ones in the set.</p><p>N: <em>(with great incredulity)</em> Do you actually get bored?</p><p>S: Sometimes, yeah.</p><p>N: But it’s so hectic, there’s so much to do!</p><p>Jon: There’s no time to get bored!</p><p>S: But you’re just on autopilot.</p><p>W: Sam’s on autopilot because he’s a slightly better musician than the rest of us.</p><p><strong>AS to S: I saw Will handed his guitar over to you at the end of ‘Faithless’ to do that solo.</strong></p><p>S: Now that I enjoy.</p><p>J: That’s his one bit of excitement.</p><p>W: Basically he wants to be on the guitar and not on the keyboard.</p><p>J: You know when you get those electric pianos and they have all the demos on them - that’s what Sam has on his keyboard so he doesn’t have to do anything.</p><p>N: You could replace Sam with a little girl and the whole show would sound the same.</p><p>S: A little girl, what are you trying to say?</p><p>W: Are you saying a little girl isn’t capable of fucking playing -<i></i></p><p>N: Okay, fine, a cake effigy <em>(they all laugh, there is an inside joke here).</em></p><p><strong>AS: [feeling left out] A cake effigy?</strong></p><p>W: Yeah, we’ve been talking about getting ‘Cake Sam’ to stand there on stage exactly as he looks, just made of cake.</p><p><strong>AS to S: How do you feel about that?</strong></p><p>S: I’m well up for it (<em>oh dear. Poor Sam. Let the boy play guitar).</em></p><p><strong>AS: Okay, so Cake Sam, that’s what we can expect next from you guys.</strong></p><p>W: Yes, Nick, Jon, Will and Cake Sam.</p><p><strong>AS: [nervous that we might talk about Cake Sam for the next 15 minutes] I was on the phone to my mum earlier and told her I was doing this interview -</strong></p><p>W: Is she a star baker?</p><p><strong>AS: No but she did shame me for not having read Brideshead Revisited. <em>(She tells me that S. Flyte is the name of a charming, outwardly carefree but seriously messed up posh boy and wants to know if this an influence for naming the band)</em></strong></p><p>W: Good segway from Cake Sam into Brideshead.</p><p><b>AS: Thank you.</b></p><p>S: It’s quite a lot to read a whole novel for an interview with a band.</p><p>W: But you’re an English Lit student.</p><p><strong>AS: Yes. How do you know that? <em>(Ally remembers that she is wearing thick glasses and knitwear)</em></strong></p><p>S: You mentioned you read English. We didn’t know it was literature.</p><p>W: Well I assumed. All of our fans are English Literature students.</p><p><strong>AS: Are they? Because it’s lyrical?</strong></p><p>W: I don’t know why but every single fucking one of them studies English Literature <em>(he laughs)</em>. My parents are English teachers so maybe that’s something to do with it. But the demographic seems to be very consistently students and predominantly Literature students, which I like; it makes me feel good.</p><p><strong>AS: Do you all write?</strong></p><p>W: Yes, we all write everything equally. I write the words but other than that the music is spookily four ways.</p><p><strong>AS: Do you have writing sessions? How do you do it?</strong></p><p>W: We do. Never more than the four of us, I’d say. The four of us can work together in a musical capacity but I think if you want to work with words it can’t be more than groups of two.</p><p><strong>AS: It’s harder to be vulnerable, maybe.</strong></p><p>W: Maybe it is - I was about to say it’s too much committeeing of creative ideas but it’s probably a lot to do with that.</p><p><strong>AS: So do the harmonies come early?</strong></p><p>W: Not necessarily. We do like to build songs in that traditional way of having a song well written in its base form. Then whatever you do to the song is going to enhance it.</p><p><strong>AS: Do you sing everything around one mic when you record it?</strong></p><p>W: The three of them sing their stuff round one mic and I do the lead vocal on a separate one. The process is quite fun -</p><p>N: Fun is a strong word. <em>(They all laugh. Has clearly at times been Not Fun.)</em></p><p>W: Fun for me, not for them. I get to sit between the two speakers and listen to the physical outcome of where they’re all stood. So if Nick’s stood too close or the vowel sound isn't quite right. There are tiny little nuances that make the vocal blend exactly right and it’s completely wrong until it’s right. So that’s really fun.</p><p><strong>AS: Do you find that your songs transform a lot as you build on them?</strong></p><p>W: Yeah, of course. The myth is that a song’s a song. A song can be good or bad depending on how the arrangement is executed. We’ve had a lot of songs that I think are great in their base form and we’ve pretty much slaughtered them by giving them the wrong arrangement, and it can be down to one tiny little thing. The minute you bring drums into it, for instance, that completely shapes and defines a song.</p><p><strong>AS to J: Do you stick to the classic kit, or do you use all sorts of weird things when you’re recording?</strong></p><p>J: I used a sponge at one point. I’ve used various different pieces of cleaning equipment to make sounds on my snare drum but I do stick to a normal kit.</p><p><em>WILL stands, whispers something, and leaves. “Did he say he’s going for a poo?”, “No, I think it was pop to the loo”. Shame. Would have been quite the exit.</em></p><p><em>Encouraged by 3/4 of the band I am to write: interview holds. WILL pops for a poo.</em></p><p><strong>AS: Do you have a favourite song to perform?</strong></p><p>S: I think ‘Cathy Come Home’, probably.</p><p><strong>AS: Is that because it gets people going?</strong></p><p>S: It’s a very dynamic arrangement, with lots of tempo changes and instrument changes so it’s good fun.</p><p>J: It’s a bit of a singalong.</p><p>N: I think unanimously it’s our favourite. It’s really easy to fuck it up, which makes it exciting each night.</p><p><strong>AS: Do you find performing them that the songs end up changing shape - i.e. they’re not what they are in the studio?</strong></p><p>S: No, because in the studio we play them more or less live, so they’re basically exactly like they are in recording.</p><p>W: What did you think of the set? You know the record.</p><p><strong>AS: I loved it. It was like listening to the album. It sounded clean.</strong></p><p>S: In a good way?</p><p><strong>AS: In a good way. Nick Mulvey played Edinburgh last month and his audience had a similar stillness to yours tonight. Everyone was really drinking it in as you played.</strong></p><p>W: I think it’s beginning to be a bit old fashioned, the idea that you have to be jumping around in an audience to show appreciation - or moving at all. Techno and EDM redefined it so that the audience was the performer and the music was there to serve the audience. But with this kind of music it’s not that at all really, is it, you’re there to watch people on stage doing all the work. It hasn't changed.</p><p><strong>AS: Are you trying to nod back to the 60s and 70s?</strong></p><p>S: Not intentionally, no. We just do because that’s the stuff we like.</p><p>N: We have a broad taste though.</p><p>W: We’re listening to a whole range of things. I wouldn’t want people to think we’re just sat there listening to the The Beatles all day long.</p><p>N: Or trying to emulate them in any way.</p><p>W: The thing about the Beatles is that as songwriters we started off listening to them.</p><p><strong>AS: They could do melody.</strong></p><p>W: Exactly and you can’t really escape that as an influence.</p><p>N: With the arrangements we’ve tried to be a little more original.</p><p>W: Or just timeless. Four voices round a mic isn’t old school and it’s not modern either. The hope is that it’s timeless.</p><p><strong>AS: Were you in choirs?</strong></p><p>J: Will and I were in a choir for a couple of years.</p><p>W: Nick and I first met when we were really young children doing a Gilbert and Sullivan community children’s musical thing.</p><p><strong>AS: Rock ‘n’ roll. How young were you when you met?</strong></p><p>N: I was about ten.</p><p>W: So I was about nine. Jon and I were also at school together.</p><p><strong>AS: So when did you know there was going to be a band? Always?</strong></p><p>W: When did we meet, seven? I’d say eight and a half: band. Even then I remember a band with a couple of mates and I was on clarinet. Jon was playing drums. And some guy was on the classical guitar like that kid in School of Rock. Sam joined us when we were quite far down the line of being in shit bands, trying things, throwing them in the bin.</p><p>J: Nick’s taken offence at that. He wants to say ‘speak for yourself’, don’t you Nick?</p><p>N: <em>(laughs)</em> I was in different bands until these guys; I knew them though, and so when they moved to London I joined the band -  a couple of years ago - then we met Sam.</p><p><strong>AS: So if you were in lots of ‘shit bands’ when did this band manage to -</strong></p><p>W: To not be shit anymore? <em>(laughs)</em> It was kind of a constant, continuous build towards where we ended up. Jon and I were always in bands with members coming and going, building what we were and what we wanted. Writing the shit songs is it, I think. You have to write lots of bad songs to get them out the way until you get to the good ones.</p><p><strong>AS: Where did you record this album?</strong></p><p>W: In Australia, funnily enough.</p><p><strong>AS: How did that happen?</strong></p><p>W: <em>(laughs)</em> We were producing a track ourselves in London called Please Eloise and we weren’t really getting the mix right. It was all recorded but the end sound was wrong.  We were fed up. Then we heard Courtney Barnett, she’s an Australian artist with a storytelling kind of vocal which is really good and a similar sound to what we were going for with PE. The record company tracked the producer down; he was an indie producer in the middle of nowhere in Australia and he did an amazing job. So when it came to making the album we went to work with him out there, because once you’ve got the flight over you may as well be there for six weeks!.</p><p><strong>AS: When do you think you’ll do a second album?</strong></p><p>S: Well we’re working on it now, so it’ll be out next year.</p><p><strong>AS: Do you think it’ll have a different kind of sound?</strong></p><p>W: We were having this discussion earlier actually. I think it wants to be an extension and evolution from what we’ve just done.</p><p><strong>AS: Did you ever sit down and have a conversation about what you wanted the album to be?</strong></p><p>S: Not really. There wasn’t a blueprint.</p><p>N: We’re quite prone to just going off in a million directions which is why it took so long to form an album. When we got into the studio it started taking shape slowly but then when it finally happened - it was actually after we’d started mixing it - it was like okay, this is the record. We understand it now. It was after that we understood it, not during the process.</p><p>W: It’s hell, basically, in the studio. It’s like dipping your head under water and going ‘I wonder when and how I’m going to get my head back out of this’. You’re completely bemused as to how it’s all going to end.</p><p>S: I quite enjoyed it, contrary to what he’s saying.</p><p><em>NICK walks to the fridge. JON, who has been very quiet until now, finds his voice: (stage whisper) Nick! Can I have a beer?</em></p><p><strong>AS: It must be quite exhausting.</strong></p><p>W: Yeah absolutely, it is a bit of a marathon making an album.</p><p><strong>AS: How do you know when an album is done?</strong></p><p>W: When someone says they aren't paying for it anymore.</p><p>N: <em>(laughs)</em> Yeah, then you’re done.</p><p>W: No, we knew when it was finished, we had the ten tracks.</p><p>S: We could have done more. We finished mixing at 4am and we had a flight in a few hours.</p><p>J: We finished as we were jumping in the car, handing over the USB stick. We knew we wanted it to be ten tracks, very OCD of us.</p><p>W: It’s never finished is it? Everyone has that when they’re making something, you always could be happier with it. But it’s that nice moment where a little bit of time passes and you haven’t heard it in a while and you hear it - I had that the other day. I listened to to it in the car from start to finish. It was like yeah, I’m really proud of this, but it was the first time in a long time I’d enjoyed it <em>(laughs).</em></p><p><strong>AS: On that note, leaving this conversation a little unfinished, I will let you be free. Thank you for your time!</strong></p><p><em>Flyte’s debut album The Loved Ones is out now.</em></p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/Xqf_KQUB-4.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The London Concertante Chamber Ensemble are performing in Edinburg<em>h this weekend at St. Giles Cathedral. As the name suggests, they're a group of musicians from London with a passion for Chamber music, they have travelled the globe with tours to the Middle East, USA, France, Finland and Spain. We spoke to Sean Morris to find out what the Ensemble are really like before their show.</em></p><p><strong>You’re performing in St. Giles cathedral, does performing in a cathedral change the acoustics of the concert?</strong></p><p>Performing in Cathedral’s is our usual gig. Sometimes we play in ‘proper’ concert halls like Cadogan, Usher, or St. George’s Halls, but it isn’t our mainstay. Different cathedral’s have different challenges though, particularly acoustically. Sometime the more aesthetically beautiful ones don’t necessarily have the most handy acoustics! Luckily, St. Giles’s has both. Its a very kind place to play, which means pretty much anywhere you sit it sounds great (it also means the sound carries further!). Sometimes buildings can be to dry where the sound doesn’t carry, or too echoey so its difficult to hear the detail - particularly in fast passages - but St. Giles’s is one of our favourite places to play because its so audience and player friendly!</p><p><strong>Your concert on the 1st and 2nd has a great student discount, I’ve noticed this is becoming a trend at many classical music venues, I have attended a concert for as little as £3. With the events looking more appealing to young people have you noticed a change in the composition of your audience?</strong></p><p>We have noticed a change in our audience, particularly in urban areas. The country side and more parochial places remain somewhat a challenge however, but that is perhaps because they have an older demographic!</p><p>I think classical music is having to change and reach out to a younger audience in a different way. Not necessarily because it's less attractive musically than other forms of music, but perhaps because it retains an heir of elitism and expensiveness (something that stems more from the opera house than the concert hall I think). Young people have less money and more worries than say 30 years ago, especially when the current government seems to be putting seemingly ever increasing economic pressure and responsibility on the youth even once they’ve left school! So Classical Music as a whole has to adapt to a shifting market - we need an audience, but also play this music because we, like any artist, believe in it and want to share it. The sad thing is that the more cuts that are made to the arts, the more reliant even large orchestras become on public funding and tickets.. but we try where we can. We want everyone to love this music and we need to make it accessible without targeting just one economic class or generation of people!</p><p><strong>Is there still more that could be done to change the composition of your audience?</strong></p><p>I think this leads on from my previous answer. There is still work to be done. The average age of our audience tends to be between 30-50, i.e. people that have perhaps found their feet economically, thinking about or have a family etc. But we remember what it was like to be young. While we’re not naive enough to think all young people would come if tickets were just £2 (one’s basic musical taste obviously has a role to play!), but we do think if you come along you’ll enjoy it. We have begun this student ticket scheme fairly recently, and have plans in the future for further outreach and perhaps even bigger more regular discounts at large venues like St.Giles’s or Cadogan Hall in London.</p><p>Education if the best way to tackle change and progression in such an issue as addressing the perception of classical music from those under 21, but the best way to get them in firstly is to be down to earth and start lowering prices.</p><p><strong>If you could include any non-classical instrument into your chamber ensemble what would it be?</strong></p><p>Hmmm… well sometimes we’ve had an accordion in quite regularly a few years ago to play some Tango! (Chris the musical director has a big thing for Latin American music). Personally I’d enjoy an electric guitar and bass playing through some Bach cello suites (but I think thats been done on youtube somewhere already!)</p><p><strong>Do you have any opportunities for younger people to get involved with the London Concertante?</strong></p><p>Aside from the ticket prices, this year we have opened an initiative for young film/media and sound engineering students to record and edit our concerts. For a number of years we have received many requests from uni students looking for professional quality musicians for their coursework and this year thought we’d make a thing of it. Apparently classical music offers different challenges to most music, so we’re happy to help! Several times a year we visit primary schools in our local area in London and do ‘introductions to music’ and fun workshops and the like. In terms of more developed musicians in their late teens we have plans in place for rehearsal days and chamber music masterclasses from 2018 onwards, which you’ll probably see come to life during our planned Seven Sins of Tango project next year!</p><p><strong>When you are not rehearsing what music would you prefer to listen to; classical or contemporary?</strong></p><p>Personally, I listen to all sorts when I’m away from rehearsals. Mostly its bebop jazz, big band crooners or Hip Hop. Our MD loves a bit of Latin America and Laura Marling, and our soloist for the evening at St. Giles’s, Ben Norris, has a MASSIVE thing for 90’s pop and Whitney Houston ballads! I’m not sure you’d catch many of us listening to classical music on our phones or iPods walking around!</p><p><strong>You’ve performed at some festivals and clubs- is this a very different experience to that of your more common venues like St. Martin-in-the-Fields?</strong></p><p>I think performing is the same wherever you go, just with some slight variations. But Festivals are always exciting, the audience is always a bit more raucous and loud in their appreciation. I’ve never been a big fan of sitting silently for ages and waiting 25/30 mins to clap. If you like it, show it, and if you have a drink in your hand, all the better! Maybe its why live jazz is sometimes more appealing as a social occasion.. !</p><p><strong>The London Concertante will be performing on the 1st and 2nd December in St. Gile’s Cathedral, Edinburgh.</strong></p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/g57M3gk_JW.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><i>Bad Sounds are a band from Bath, whose sound takes influence from a variety of genres - stretching from old school Hip Hop, forgotten progressive rock albums to the King of Pop himself. They have released several singles and two EPs in the past and are currently touring the UK. Nani Porenta sat down with them before their show at the Mash House in Edinburgh.</i></p><p><b>Your most recent single ‘Are you high?’ was given the title of “Hottest record in the world” by Annie Mac for BBC 1. That’s a title that’s been given to artists like Beck, the Foo Fighters or Lana del Rey for example. Was that a milestone for you and how do you take stuff like that in?</b></p><p>Callum: It’s a weird thing for it to be happening to us. I think we’re just really grateful for it. I know obviously with those types of slots you have big labels who are pushing for those types of things. So, there is a lot of pressure on people at Radio to fill those slots with stuff. And it’s amazing for us that Annie just gave it to us. The first time she gave it to us we were totally unsigned she had no reason to do it, except for the fact she liked us. We were super shocked, and it’s obviously awesome for us. We weren’t complaining.</p><p>Ewan: For us it’s more like Annie’s continued support of us, rather than the kudos of having it. Someone off their own back is just like “I really like these guys and I want to support them”.</p><p><b>Why bad sounds by the way?</b></p><p>Ewan: It’s a really boring story. We had this demo before we were a band, when we were just recording at home. We really like the song, but all the sounds just sucked, they were just really bad. So, we labelled that demo ‘Bad sounds’. Much, much later when we were trying to come up with a band name, we were just coming up with terrible, terrible names. We ended up ditching them all and just going back to the name of the first demo we worked on.</p><p>I really like it now, at the time I was like “Oh god, this is such a dreadful name”. But the fact that it was the best out of that whole list, really says a lot about how bad that list was.</p><p><b>You have dropped some great stuff like your EPs <i>PHRESSSH</i> and <i>Mixtape One</i> and your current single ‘Are you high?’. Can we expect a debut album any time soon?</b></p><p>Callum: We’re sort of writing with a view to an album at the minute, but we don’t have any dates. We’re not really setting it up as what it’s going to be. We’re just trying to write what feels right to as now and then hopefully it will form a cohesive thing. It’s part of what <i>Mixtape One</i> was - this first go at trying to make the whole thing a cohesive piece of work and not just our ten most commercial sounding songs.</p><p>Ewan:  It’s really important to us that whatever we put out as our debut album is a worthwhile piece of music as a whole. When we talk about our favourite albums a lot of them are artists’ debut album, when they’re still trying out ideas, being brave and pushing boundaries. It’s just a lot to be said about just really throwing your all into it. So, we’re really keen not to jut whatever the next ten songs we write that will be the album, we don’t want to do that. We want to write a whole bunch of songs and then choose which songs fit best together and then weave them into something that really works and flows well.</p><p><b>Let’s talk about song-writing a bit. What kind of process do you have?</b></p><p>Ewan: It varies from song to song how it starts. ‘Are you high?’ for example - we wrote just melodies [first], before we did anything else. It was really weird. I was watching something on TV and the adverts came on. I went and got a drink and hummed the melody and thought “that’s kind of cool” and just recorded it on my phone. We then just build the whole song around it, which we’ve never done before.</p><p>And other times you just start with a beat, a little guitar riff or a piano lick – chords or whatever. There’s not one way to writing a song. And if you feel like you’ve found the formula to writing a song, you’re just going to write the same song a lot.</p><p>Callum: I think we’re still finding our way, still trying to learn from other people. Do a lot of interview watching and listening to music and trying to find new things we can try. The lyrics also comes from conversations and people we actually know, sort of trying to form it into what feels right in a song, that’s normally what starts off the song – it’s a line, and then join the dots.</p><p><b>Then for example for ‘Zachariah’ – how did the lyrics fit in that song?</b></p><p>Callum: I don’t know, everybody always asks about this ‘Zachariah’ thing – like “Who’s Zachariah?”. It was based mainly on one friend, but his name is not Zachariah. That line just sort of came straight when we had the beat – trying out that first melody, sometimes the first thing that comes just feels right – and for some reason it was that lyric and the phrasing of it. But the Michael Jackson influence is huge, that’s probably our biggest collective influence. I think he was the first musician [Ewan and I] were both into. Probably the same for most people.</p><p><b>Which of your songs would you say has the best story behind it?</b></p><p>Ewan: My favourite in terms of stories is ‘Avalanche’, because there’s three stories in one.  Each verse is about a different person. I just really like the little tales within it, they’re kind of open for interpretation. There’s just something about it. And the “Julie” who’s in verse two – when she first heard it she was like “Is that about me?” and I said, “Yeah it’s a story you once told me one day at work”. That’s probably my favourite. That’s where we found where we were comfortable writing lyrics and doing that sort of style just taking lines out of conversation with people and putting it into a song.</p><p><b>Looking at your videos: The ET reference in ‘Living alone’ or the Bruce Lee one for ‘Wages’ – how did you come up with those ideas?</b></p><p>Callum: I didn’t actually want to do a bad B-movie – I wanted to do a proper martial arts movie. I literally wanted to do a 100-grant budget [movie].  I remember sending our manager footage – chopped up from “Crouching tiger hidden dragon” and said, “This would be the bomb – this is how we make it”. That was obviously never going to happen, so we thought it would be funny to edit us on top of that stuff. Plus, we’ve never been the band to be the moody cool band and we never wanted to be that band. So, we thought, if it makes us laugh and if we think it’s cool – then let’s just put it out and see what other people think.</p><p>Ewan: A lot of the videos are just imagery that we like as well. Sometimes you have to tie a bit of a story line into it – like we tried with ‘Living alone’. But most of the time, like with the Kung Fu stuff – we really liked that aesthetic and it probably played a much bigger role in sort of our development than we realized – that whole scene – so we were pretty keen to play on it.</p><p><b>A lot of people say your gigs are just a big party and you include the audience really well. How do you achieve that when being on stage?</b></p><p>Ewan: I think it’s just us vibing off what we do and just really enjoying the music that we’re making. It helps that we’re playing as five people that really get on. A lot of it has to do with the people who come to see us as well, when we can see that they’re having a good time and we’re having a good time – it’s just this incredible cycle of good vibrations really.</p><p>Callum: Again, we don’t want to be the moody cool band, so we never really take that stance to just stand up there, look cool and don’t really do anything. I think we’re just a bit silly on stage and it seems that the crowds so far liked that – or at least most of the time.</p>",

      "html": "<p><i>La Traviata</i> is a well-known opera throughout the world. Even people who have not seen it will recognise the song ‘Brindisi’ immediately. Verdi’s heart-breaking opera about ‘the fallen woman’, meaning <i>La Traviata</i>, tells the story of a woman finding love, without expecting it. Merely to be thrown into a turmoil of emotions, honour, betrayals and misunderstandings. This up and down of emotions is portrayed through astonishing music.</p><p>The beautiful courtesan Violetta has an exciting city life full of parties and several suiters, granting her a luxurious lifestyle. The young Alfredo Germont, from the countryside, has been in love for her since he has seen her for the first time and was checking up on her every day during her period of sickness without her noticing. Although Violetta does not want to fall in love and have an actual relationship with someone she cannot stop herself of falling for Alfredo after he devotes himself totally to her. Once they confess their love are happy and move away from their former party friends to a countryside estate. But money runs out and both try to handle it themselves without telling the other one. And while they try to sort out their life to stay together Alfredo’s father shows up demanding the biggest sacrifice from Violetta, to leave Alfredo forever. A lot of broken hearts, misunderstandings, revenge attempts and horrible twists of fate are the basis of this emotional story perfect for an opera.</p><p>The Scottish Opera selected a talented cast that managed to fill their challenging roles perfectly. Especially, Gulnara Shafigullina, playing Violetta Valery, and Stephen Gadd, as Giorgio Germont, mesmerized the audience with their performance. It is the perfect combination of acting and singing skills that define the high standard.</p><p>The performance itself was done very traditionally, including the stage decoration and the costumes. No effort was taken in giving it a modern or new twist. This is a shame as the well-known opera and story would profit from at least a few small updates. Obviously, first time viewers might appreciate the traditional setting, which has been done beautifully, but this cast could have managed to take a risk and be a bit more experimental and creative.</p><p>All in all, this performance of <i>La Traviata</i> promises a great night out with excellent music and cast. In addition to this it offers a short trip back in time to a dramatic, fictional love story in France.</p><p>Verdi’s gripping and heart-breaking opera<i> La Traviata</i>,<i> </i>full of twists and misunderstandings, will be performed at the Festival Theatre in Edinburgh:</p><p>Wed 15, Sun 19, Tue 21, Thu 23 &amp; Sat 25 November, Evenings 7.15pm (not Sun) Matinee Sun 3pm.</p><p>For more details please take a look at http://www.edtheatres.com/latraviata.</p><p>It will be also performed in Glasgow at the Theatre Royal 28<sup>th</sup> November – 2<sup>nd</sup> December.

We’re here to interview Bradley of Bloody Knees, who’ve just released their EP <em>Maybe It’s Easy</em> on Distiller Records. As it turns out, he's in the next door booth! He’s even clocked us chatting about our questions. He hops round, and we begin the interview. After it ends, we head down into the basement for the gig. The performance is energetic: Bradley contorts himself around the guitar and eggs on the crowd, who clearly love it - they know the words to pretty much every song. It’s clear this band is one with a dedicated following, and you can see why - Bloody Knees are definitely one to watch out for.</p><p><i><em>Bloody Knees’ ‘Maybe it’s Easy’ tour concludes in Manchester on the 9</em><sup><em>th</em></sup><em> December. Tickets are available at </em></i><a href=\"https://www.songkick.com/\"><i><u><em>https://www.songkick.com/</em></u></i></a><i><em> .</em></i></p><p>D: F*ck marry kill: Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, and Ringo Starr</p><p>B: Okay, I have a strong suspicion that Ringo Starr is a passionate lover, anyone that can keep a solid rhythm for that amount of time, ‘cos I wouldn’t want to f*ck Mick Jagger, I’d feel like one of his many, you know what I mean, I wouldn’t feel special. Alright so me and Ringo will f*ck, who are the other two?</p><p>D: Mick Jagger and Bob Dylan</p><p>B: Ooh so I’m gonna marry Bob Dylan, 100%.. And yeah that means I’m gonna kill Mick Jagger, it’s not that I’m not into the Stones, but…</p><p>D: How would you do it?</p><p>B: Ooh, quick and painless man, I’d probably just.. I don’t know, like what’s.. There is no quick and painless, I’d just have to sneak one in the back of his head, so that he didn’t know, and then I’d, I dunno, I ‘d have to kill myself after that, that would be horrendous. I’d leave poor Bob Dylan a widower! This is not gonna end well for anyone, genuinely [laughs]</p><p>F: What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p><p>B: Oh, that’s a good question… We were actually listening to the Beatles in the van on the way up here, so I’ve got Beatles songs stuck in my head right now, but before that, I dunno, we’ve only just managed to make the radio in the van work, by the way, so today we were listening to Beatles and everyone was like ‘this is amazing!’ but like the whole two weeks up until now we’ve not had any music so it’s been a bit, a bit quiet, so I’ve just been in my head.. To be honest probably ‘Beautifully Unconventional’ by Wolf Alice, yeah it’s just a really catchy song. They’re friends of ours from way back, and when they put this album out I was just super stoked, it’s a really good album, and that song is just catchy, man.</p><p>D: If you weren’t doing this, what would you be doing?</p><p>B: Ok, so, thing is I am doing this but I still have to work a job, cos rock and roll don’t pay the bills unless you’re signed to a massive label who wanna chuck loads of money at you. So I work for a jewellery company in London, which I do enjoy. So, I guess I’d just be doing that, or something else, I dunno, it’s difficult to think, cos if I didn’t have the band, I’d have to find something else that I was passionate about.</p><p>D: What’s your favourite film? Or if that’s too tricky a really good one you’ve seen recently</p><p>B: Ooh, I really liked the new Blade runner, that was really cool - it just looked amazing. If you haven’t seen it, do see it. I think I will have to say, and this is not ‘exciting’ or whatever, but my favourite films to watch are the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I’ve got the extended edition Blu-ray box set and it’s amazing, I watch it - since I’ve owned it’s been watched at least twice a year, start to finish. And that’s a lot of hours, man, that’s 12 hours a go! So yeah it’s not like a cult thingy, or anything cool, and it don’t make me look good but yeah I like The Lord of The Rings.</p><p>D: Classics, though. Do you marathon them?</p><p>B: I do, well, I used to, but my girlfriend isn’t very good at that, she likes to have breaks or she gets tired and goes to sleep, which is really frustrating for me because I have to then pause it because she’s there and I’m trying to make her watch it, you know what I mean? [laughs] ‘If you’re stopping, then I’m stopping, and we’ll reconvene at a later date’. But yeah, 100% my favourite films are the Lord of the Rings films.</p><p>F: What’s the best gig you’ve ever played?</p><p>B: Uh, that would have been Thursday the Second of November, 2017. So last week, London. We sold out Camden Assembly [A new 400 person venue in North London] and the crowd went nuts - it was the best thing I’ve ever done, ever. It was the best thing as a band, we’ve ever done: to sell out a show in London is a pretty big thing for us, we’ve not done it before, so we were really excited. The fact that everyone was singing along to the new songs, as much as (if not more than) the older songs, that felt like we were really doing something right. So yeah, that was easily up there as one of the best moments of my musical life. Really cool, really cool.</p><p>F: Have you got any pre-gig rituals?</p><p>B: Nope! It’s different every time. It all depends on the venue man, if there’s somewhere where I can tuck myself away, like a quiet room, I’ll probably do some vocal warm-ups or whatever, but if there’s nowhere to do it I just won’t bother. I’ll suffer for it later, but it’s fine. We just kinda go on! There’s no handshakes, group chants, group hugs and that, we just get on with it. We just go ‘right, it’s time to go on lads, let’s go’, and then we go.</p><p>F: Any post-gig rituals?</p><p>B: No, I usually feel too… it’s died down a bit but for ages I always felt like I was gonna throw up afterwards, just ‘cause… it’s quite a physical thing when we play. But that hasn’t actually happened so much recently, I dunno whether I’ve just physically got accustomed to it..</p><p>D: gigging your way to fitness?</p><p>B: Yeah, it’s a workout I tell you. But yeah there’s no rituals, we’re not very ritualistic. Everything changes man, all the time.</p><p>D: What’s the first album you ever bought?</p><p>B: Well the first album I ever was bought was Bewitched. They were like a girl pop band, anyone born like ‘91, within 3 years of ‘91 either side will know who bewitched are, and that was the first album I ever had. First album I ever bought with my own money… I think it was an AC-DC album, because I wanted to learn how to play guitar, and Dad was like, ‘well, if you wanna learn how to play guitar, this is what you should listen to!’ … Thing is, I always bought singles, as a kid, it was like 1.99, 2.99 or whatever. That was always where I’d spend my money.</p><p>D: I didn’t even know they did those!</p><p>B: Yeah yeah, man one of the first ones I ever bought - I bought two in the same day. I bought ‘It wasn’t me’ by Shaggy, and I bought… There was an England song, I can’t remember who the lads who did it were, but it was ‘Sven Sven Sven’, so I actually bought that single, you know - it was football fever around the time… So there’s a few options for you!</p><p>F: Ok, we’ve got some quick questions for you.</p><p>B: Anything you want, yep.</p><p>D: Jazz flute or cowbell?</p><p>B: Cowbell. 100%.</p><p>F: Beatles or Stones?</p><p>B: Beatles.</p><p>D: Any particular Beatle?</p><p>B: I’m gonna have to say… John Lennon, he’s a G! Like… Yeah we were having this discussion in the van, like… ‘Do you reckon he’d be cool, now, if he’d never got killed… Or would he be annoying us all a bit like Paul McCartney is?’… If it ain’t John Lennon it’s Ringo. I think Ringo is the unsung hero.</p><p>D: Gravy or Curry on chips?</p><p>B: Curry, 100%.</p><p>D: Pixies or Nirvana?</p><p>B: Nirvana. And when I was in my early teenage years, that was just what it was. I listened to that all the time. So yeah, 100% Nirvana, man.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/CJycREBQpg.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>As someone who has considered taking a ten-hour bus from Vienna to Zurich to see Lucy Rose live, excited doesn’t even begin to describe how I feel about actually getting to see her in Edinburgh.</p><p>Arriving at The Caves early last Tuesday, my wait is pleasantly shortened by supporting act Charlie Cunningham – whose unbelievable Latin-music-like guitar skills and smooth voice are unfortunately drowned by the ever-mumbling crowd.</p><p>Due to him only using his guitar and performing on his own, the equipment on stage doesn’t need to be changed and after a short break the soft sound of a harp playing the same introduction as on her most recent album <i>Something’s Changing</i> is enough to shut everyone up with just the first few notes.</p><p>Not a minute later Lucy Rose and her four-piece band swiftly enter the stage and directly go into the song ‘Is This Called Home’. Every single person in that room is immediately touched by her music; her voice just creeps underneath everybody’s skin, enough to induce goosebumps.</p><p>About a third into the concert and several emotional minutes later, she plays ‘Middle of the Bed’. With those rhythmic guitar riffs supported by gentle drum beats one could be reminded of Katie Melua, which makes one wonder why this incredible artist isn’t better known.</p><p>In addition to Lucy Rose’s undeniable talent, her band is also absolutely incredible. In particular, her bassist and backup singer: a 6’6’’ potential look-a-like for Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, who probably eats what I eat in a week for breakfast but who sings in a falsetto voice that has the ability to make even the most hardened stoic cry.</p><p>What else could make Lucy Rose even more likeable? Her sense of humour.</p><p>Joking throughout the entire evening and making a couple remarks about how her music is often described as too soft for a lot of people and not hesitating to make fun of herself, she has the entire crowd wrapped around her finger.</p><p>Surprisingly, Lucy Rose appears to have a big fan base within the 60+ age group. That becomes apparent as she is talking about how only a few people would comment on her music with a phrase like “I fucking love it”, but at that point a man in his 60s (who happens to smell of whisky) comes up to me with the biggest smile and says, “This is Mr. Fucking-Loves-It” while pointing at himself. It was incredibly endearing.</p><p>Before ending her concert with an encore, she revisits her earlier musical stages by singing ‘Shiver’, - which unfortunately is majorly interrupted by a drunk person stumbling down the stairs. This leads to a moment of sincerity. She admits to having come close to quitting writing songs recently, as she felt like nobody wanted to listen to her work. However, she explains she had a change of heart while going on tour in South America, because she felt “that if there’s even only one person that loves my music – it is worth making it.”</p><p>I most certainly had a lovely evening, and I hope this one person is enough.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/5MyOKjZ6cM.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Marika Hackman’s first performance at Glasgow’s famous King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut grabs your attention fully, with the English singer-songwriter launching her set with one of the more upbeat numbers from <em>I’m Not Your Man</em>, ‘Good Intentions’. The noisy guitar fuzz reverberates around the small venue, accompanied by the headbanging of Hackman and her guitarist. Her songs are a little more brash than they were in <em>That Iron Taste</em> and <em>We Slept at Last</em>, the drums, bass and rhythm guitar punching through the audience as Hackman’s siren-like voice begins to fill the room.</p><p>Hackman’s songs seem to always carry a hint of menace, at the very least. Even if it’s only in the melody, there’s a sense of danger hanging over her music. Her debut album could very well be used as a soundtrack for a horror film, and this character carries over to a few of the tracks on <em>I’m Not Your Man</em>. Hackman’s voice can be full of threat when the moment requires it, and she uses this talent to the fullest, staring down the crowd as her band thrash and yell along to the songs. The gig feels almost like it’s as much a time for the band to go wild as it for the audience.</p><p>Hackman’s set is short, but filled with well-chosen tracks. Along with songs from her last record, the shoegaze-like <em>I’m Not Your Man</em>, Marika and her band play a few tracks from her previous albums, reworking them as grungier numbers. They’re great additions to the setlist, showing the audience a new side to Hackman’s older songs. ‘Bath is Black’ swirls around the stage, filled with more energetic, less spectral electric guitars instead of the original acoustic instrumentation. It brings a moment of calm to the raucous set. Hackman also plays a bonus track from <em>I’m Not Your Man</em> as well, ‘Majesty’, a slow, seductive song that thrums into your brain. The band keeps the audience in their grasp with these winding melodies just as they had with the bigger, more explosive numbers.</p><p>The crowd, though small, feels much larger with the amount of dancing that’s going on. They reach a fever pitch towards the end of the show, during ‘Boyfriend’, the lead single from <em>I’m Not Your Man</em>, a sarcastic needling of male insecurity and society’s view of lesbian relationships.</p><p>The show ends with ‘My Lover Cindy’, a song filled with braggadocio and lust, where Hackman shouts at the top of her lungs “I’m gonna get my fill / I’m gonna keep my eyes on the prize and I’ll suck you dry / I will”, her voice filled with so much certainty that you’re sure she’ll get what she wants. As the band leaves the stage, we’re left with a lasting warm feeling in our chests and grins on our faces. Hackman’s a somewhat singular voice in the UK rock scene at the moment, and I wouldn’t miss a show of hers, given the chance.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/8I5z6pvaTz.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>In the digital age of music we are more exposed than ever to a rich variety of music with a vast range of genres and subgenres. Bands are no less exposed to this experience than we are and this could lead us to a new age of music in which the borders between genres are dissolved altogether. Yonaka's sound can be seen as on the borderline of many genres. The Brighton-based band, not quite sure what to pin themselves down as, feel more comfortable to leave this decision to the fans.</p><p>With Yonaka, the influences of various genres do not end with the sound of the music itself. At Sneaky Pete’s the band bring in the energy of an old school hip-hop concert, while exerting heavy punk riffs to kick the energy into overdrive. Right from the get-go, Yonaka are ready to fire up the audience and it works. The likeability of each band member makes the crowd even more enthusiastic about the performance. Right from the first song, the lead singer Theresa Jarvis charms the audience and projects the energy she expects from the audience with her gestures and dances. Guitarists, George Edwards and Alex Crosby portray the typical demeanour of rockstars, swinging side to side with their hair all over the place. Crosby and Edwards look so focused it is as if they are battling to control their guitars.</p><p>The band starts by playing 'Run and Salty', the first song from the <em>HEAVY EP.</em> Yonaka never lets the energy die, jumping from one song to the next. The third song, “Wouldn’t Wanna Be Ya” is one of the more emotional songs, especially for Theresa Jarvis. Even for a song as expressive as it is, the atmosphere does not dissipate for a moment. In the more serious moments of the song Jarvis approaches the edge of the stage, head in her lap, muttering the lyrics. The lights dim and the audience is given a breather to connect with the reflective mind of Theresa Jarvis.</p><p>Following ‘WWBY, the transition to the next couple of songs is swift again. The second half is another mix of singles and music from the <em>HEAVY EP</em>. They go back and forth between their singles such as 'Drongo', 'Loner' and 'Iggy', which are balanced out by 'Gods &amp; Lovers', 'Heavy' and 'All In My Head'. Yonaka amps up the crowd again, engaging the audience with the call and response commonly found in hip-hop concerts. Jarvis is centrestage feeding off the energy of the drummer Robert Mason consistently controlling the tempo and Crosby and Edwards supply that gritty style for which Yonaka is known. All members bounce and mnemonically sway to their fast paced music.</p><p>The performance caps off with ‘Bubblegum’, one of the most popular songs from <em>HEAVY</em>. In 'Bubblegum', the entire energy culminates into the ultimate experience for the crowd. As the guitars blare and the drum pumps, Jarvis cries “I, I, I, I, I/ I want it right now”. Each repetition of the verse brings Jarvis a step closer to the edge of the stage, literally. Once the song reaches its climax, all hell breaks loose. Jarvis jumps in with the audience, handing over the microphone to the fans who eagerly sing along with her. Jarvis goes further and further into the crowd singing and dancing, engagement with the fans now at its peak. As the performance draws to a close, the guitars crescendo to usher in the end of the act. Yonaka sticks around for a drink after the performance and encourages the audience to stay. People line up to thank the band for their performance and to shower the band with praise. Some members of the crowd admit they had never heard of Yonaka until that night at Sneaky Pete’s, but are fans by the end of the show. One couple had enjoyed Yonaka’s performance in Glasgow so much, they drove to Edinburgh to see them again.</p><p>The band strikes a resounding familiarity in its sound compared to their peers. Jarvis will have moments where she interpolates Gwen Stefani, but other times Wolf Alice. The sound coming from the instruments will make one think of Arctic Monkeys- a comparison the band are also familiar with. This does not make the band imposters by any means, as they certainly don’t lose integrity in their sound. The interpolations are not necessarily deliberate and give the audience comfort with a recognisable, yet unique sound. In many ways, Yonaka are a composition of the best of all the aforementioned artists or bands. The future is certainly bright for this young band who have only been together for two years.</p><p>Check out their new EP,  here:<br><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/4ZJhPsudePeA2takLeA2Ob\">YONAKA, HEAVY EP</a></p>",

In one and a half hours the play covers Anorexia, OCD, Depression and Anxiety – although other mental illnesses are also addressed. This is carried out through numerous monologues and duologues which are then split by a graphics played out on the white sheet backdrop.</p><p>The design of <em>Mind-Full </em>is very simple and aims to focus on what is being said. The actors are dressed in black jeans and white t-shirts, with the set composed only of white sheets and a bench. There is little in the way of distractions making the words all the more powerful; the audience are forced to focus on what is being said. In true professional style, one actor was not even distracted by the man next to me who started having a coughing fit from his beer mid-monologue.</p><p>The play is verbatim, meaning all the monologues are transcribed word-for-word from real interviews with students from Edinburgh and beyond. The play takes extracts from the interviews conducted; Katrina has edited it to make a flowing piece of work in which all the interviews work in tandem with each other. This gives the play a real resonance, as it takes mental illnesses out of abstraction. I am impressed by the honesty of those who were willing to share their experiences and I hope it inspires others to recognise that mental health is not something to be endured in isolation.</p><p><em>Mind-Full</em> cleverly informs the audience without patronising. For instance, it offers a deeper understanding of complex mental health disorders such as OCD, and how they can manifest themselves in various ways. I was particularly impacted by the realisation that I am a culprit of being insensitive to sufferers by using ‘OCD’ as a jokey adjective.</p><p>Although <em>Mind-Full </em>does not hold much of a storyline due to its nature, it finishes with a message of outreach to those suffering, and their friends and family. It suggests some positive and negative reactions when discussing mental health, and potential steps one can take to help combat these illnesses. It seems to be a fitting end; leading a difficult subject – one which society often tries to ignore – into a more open discussion. <em>Mind-Full</em> provides the audience with room for much self-reflection.</p><p><strong>Mind-Full continues its run at Assembly Roxy on the 19th and 20th November, 7pm.</strong></p>",

      "title": "Edinburgh Short FIlms Festival Day 6",
      "html": "<p>Edinburgh Short Films Festival Day 6: Overcoming at FilmHouse</p><p>An impressive variety of short films were on display on the penultimate night of the Edinburgh Short Films Festival. Although centred around the idea of overcoming, the films took on a number of different forms, eschewing, or cheerfully overplaying, the triumphant tone that the theme can often produce. The night opened with <b>A Drowning Man</b>, a short film nominally concerned with the plight of refugees in Greece, but using the situation to peer into the life of its nameless protagonist, who is truly apart. The film benefits greatly from the cine-literate writer/director Mahdi Fliefel, and the keen eye of cinematographer Vasco Viana, who turns the open streets of Athens into a jungle for the protagonist to navigate. The introspective A Drowning Man was followed by the bombastic <b>Free Period</b>, the double entendre of which I must confess I failed to grasp until the film began. This crowdfunded production is wilfully over the top, and becomes a pastiche of westerns and exploitation films, giving a resolute edge to the often-ignored subject of menstruation and the cost of tampons. The Polish animation <b>The Escape</b> is a mixed bag, with excellent and provoking animation held back by the slow pace and seemingly unending darkness. I hope that the team behind this film give their animation style another try, perhaps with the addition of dialogue. <b>Haud Close to Me</b> is an interesting combination of film, ballet and spoken word that ran the risk of coming off as pretentious, but instead evoked the same feelings one of the better John Lewis Christmas adverts, short, utterly un-ironic, and well put together. <b>The Realm of Deepest Knowing</b> served as an antidote to The Escape, dealing with the tough subject matter in a hopeful and heartfelt way. I had the chance to talk with Seung-Hee Kim who wrote, directed, and animated the film, her second short, who pointed out that despite the film having no dialogue, it is based on a very Korean understanding of the interconnected soul and mind. The hand-drawn animations are charming, and the short is filled with colour and music, and communicate the personality of a work that comes from one person. <b>Jimbo </b>benefits from being a production by short film company Imaculado, and has been working through the short film circuit over the last few months. It is a well-acted and well shot Tarantino-esque picture that retains a clear grasp on the plot, and does well to place the viewer in medias res will quickly building a world and characters. That said, one cannot help but feel Jimbo is less subversive than it thinks it is. <b>Marky’s Bad Week</b> takes the cake as the most twee film on show, using the old trope of a character who we expect to be dense or bumbling, and making him eloquent and relatable. That said Daniel Holmwood did a good job with this film, which was shot on location in Dublin, and Caolfhinn Dunne is eye catching as the yin to yang of the titular character. The evening closed with the German short <b>Nicole’s Cage</b>, an unexpected combination of Terry Gilliam style dark-whimsy, light BDSM, and Cinematography from someone who has been watching too much Wes Anderson. The short is set on a giant ferris wheel that holds a number of flats, which provide the best view in the city, but also take around an hour to rotate to the bottom if the occupant wants to exit. In presenting the viewer with such an absurd scenario, Josef Brandl, who wrote and directed the film can have fun with the plot, which is by turns comic and dark. I hope to see more of his work in the future.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/P7QtucFN7A.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The bar is fairly crowded for a Tuesday night when I first arrive at Broadcast in Glasgow. Almost immediately, a woman promoting Catholic Action hands me a free CD and pin. I get my drink and take a seat, waiting for the doors to open. It is past both of the advertised times when the doors finally open and we are let downstairs.    <br>    In a basement venue, the crowd waits for Catholic Action to take the stage. The crowd is uncharacteristically large for an opening band. Catholic Action is touring for their brand new album <em>In Memory Of</em>. Only weeks old, this album has threads of modern alternative music, but also something tantalizingly reminiscent of classic rock.</p><p><br>    The band quickly enters the stage and kicks off the show. Instantly, their sound is loud and full of bass and drums. The vocals come through clear and well complimented by the music. Having only listened to the album, it is not until they announced their name a few songs into the show that I believed it was Catholic Action on stage. Where their album is radio ready, mixed and mastered with effects to create the more alternative sound, their live show sounds more like it has emerged from a garage. This unexpected sound is incredible. All of the aspects of the album that make you want to listen more are amplified when live. The alternative sound is dropped for a classic rock infused, punk vibe.<br>    It is obvious that the majority of the crowd has come to see Catholic Action. People are doing everything from calmly standing, to bobbing along, to full out dancing. After each song there is an eruption of cheers. A photographer circles the band, letting off a strobe light like effect with their flash. Expecting to see the stiff show of a new band, I am pleasantly surprised to be at a rowdy show of a band that has obviously accumulated a following. It could not have hurt that I was seeing them in their hometown.</p><p><br>    The band plays the songs off their new album, also throwing in some unreleased tracks. Then they go into one of their singles, ‘Black &amp; White’. While listening to the album this song caught my attention but when played live it was overshadowed by the other songs of the night. <br>    Catholic Action announces they are going to play their only slow song of the night. This song is not so much slow as it is just quieter than the others. In that light, it is still not very quiet. The band takes an purposefully long pause in the middle of the song. It is just long enough that the crowd seems unsure to respond. Then in unison the song kicks off again.</p><p><br>    When Catholic Action informs us it is their last song, I realize how quick the set has passed. The band’s sound had me enthralled and I could have listened for much longer. A few people in the crowd open up a mosh. The set ends on a high note.</p>",

Two talented supporting bands, Super Inuit and Night Flowers, take the stage and as each act goes on, the room steadily fills. By the time it is Japanese Breakfast’s turn to take the stage, it is nearly a full house. <br>    Japanese Breakfast is touring in support of their new album <em>Soft Sounds from Another Planet</em>. They open the show with the first track off this album entitled ‘Diving Woman’. This almost ambient song foreshadows the tones of the record. Immediately the crowd is bobbing along. Next the band throws in two of their more popular songs from their first album, <em>Psychopomp</em>. These songs are 'In Heaven’ and ‘The Woman that Loves You’. <br>    The vocals of lead singer and mastermind of the band, Michelle Zauner, radiate throughout the crowd. Matched with the sonic instrumentation, the result is a hypnotically unique sound. The talent of this four-piece band is undeniable.</p><p><br>    With the band grooving and the songs flowing, the crowd is almost involuntarily dancing along. A shift in tone comes about three-quarters of the way into the show. Saying they are going to slow things down, the four-piece band reduces to a two-piece. This leaves only Zauner and drummer Craig Hendrix. In this manner, they play three songs, including the standout ‘Till Death’. Zauner introduces ‘Till Death’ as a song about marriage, bad things that happen in life and how they are made manageable by having someone to go through it with. The beauty of these songs captivates the audience. Though more calm and even melancholy, the crowd stays enveloped by the sound. <br>    In a sudden and clever change, the four-piece band retakes the stage and Japanese Breakfast breaks into their most popular song, ‘Everybody Wants to Love You’. Instantly the crowd is dancing again. As the closing song the band plays a more experimental track, ‘Machinist’. This song is about a woman falling in love with a robot. Though this song is more experimental, it is somehow the perfect way to end this other-worldly show. By the end of the show, those soft sounds from another planet have been brought firmly down to Earth.</p><p><br>    It was a fun and groovy show and the band’s energy was high. Between song banter was kept brief, but not too brief as to prevent Zauner from telling jokes. These included trying out her best Scottish accent and informing us on the band’s touring vices (simulated farming games for some and math for others). At some point in her jokes, Zauner seems to get embarrassed, wondering why she is sharing so much. She claims its because this is one of the first crowds on their European tour to laugh at her jokes. These funny, simple ramblings are enough to make the crowd laugh and the show just that more enjoyable. After each mini-introduction, the band goes directly back into their sonic trip.</p><p><br>    From the supporting bands, to the incredible talent of Japanese Breakfast, this show is one I am glad I did not miss.</p>",

      "html": "<p><em>Kobi Onyame is a British-Ghanaian rapper, currently based in Glasgow. He has released 3 official studio albums under his current stage name. His style is greatly influenced by the Ghanaian highlife sound and he cites British rapper Sway and Kanye West as his idols. Ares Zerunyan caught up with Kobi Onyame before the List Hot 100 Party to talk about his music and artistry.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/uHZOK9lVWY.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><b>Ares: [Something different] you did with your album was be careful in the way you released it. You took inspiration from Kanye West with <i>My Beautiful Twisted Dark Fantasy</i>, so you released different versions of the songs that were going to be on your album before the release so when people heard the singles on the album they wouldn’t just skip it.</b></p><p><b>Kobi Onyame</b>: So the initial idea… the album was ready at the top of the year, in January last year. I could have put it out in January. In the past releasing <i>Green Green Grasses</i> and <i>Gold</i>, I found what happened for me is that the album came and went. The was a lot of hype to this album, comes out on Monday or Friday lots of hype and the next day everyone forgets about it… and I didn’t want that to happen for this album just because I wanted to do a lot more, I wanted growth between the other albums.</p><p>To take it a step further, I’ll let you guys know first is that the plan for next year is to put out the visuals. So what I plan to do now is do videos for the song that will have different versions. It means that the videos will be a different mix to what was on the playlist release and the album. And when all the visuals get released next year, I can combine that and turn that into a deluxe version of the album or just keep it as is. It’s the exact same plan as with the album, we’ll be releasing the visuals slowly. I’m super excited, I’m not sure what the first visual is going to be, but it might be ‘Kill the Body’ or ‘Wedadi’. I’ve been speaking to the director last night and it’s crazy! The idea is just sick, I hope we can pull it off, and start throwing it out the same way.</p><p><b>A: You have a strong afrobeat influence in your music and so is this influence from that general west Africa area or other places on the continent, or is it Ghana specifically?</b></p><p><b>K: </b>The new album <i>Gold</i> is more Ghanaian influence. It’s more highlife influenced music that’s traditionally known to have a lot of horns, a lot of percussion and [similar to] groups like Osibisa. Osibisa were very big in the 60’s. Pat Thomas is another legendary Ghanaian musician, but then also along the region you have Fela Kuti, who’s Nigerian.</p><p>Ghanaians and Nigerians are pretty much cousins, but it all comes from the highlife sound which for me is mainly Ghanaian, Nigerian. The new album carries a lot of those undertones, it’s mainly the horn section behind the inspiration, the percussion and also the texture. I find that listening to stuff like Fela Kuti or Osibisa from the 60’s, the music wasn’t clean. The music wasn’t as digitized as it is today and you’d have a room where you’d stick drums and horns together and you’d play and there would be different faults and different mistakes. But it’s just part of the feel of the music and I just wanted to make something that carried that slightly distorted and dirty music. I felt music was going a bit too clean but for me it’s mainly Ghanaian.</p><p><b>A: you’ve got these music videos coming up next year. What does it look like down the line?</b></p><p><b>K:</b> Great question! It’s weird, it looks like more albums as they come. I don’t like to say when an albums coming. It looks like living a lot more life- using my experiences and what I’ve been able to achieve and also passing it on to someone can actually do more. I’m a bit older now so I just want to look to other artists, help younger artists, whether that be in a management role or even in an advisory role. Just live more life and put out music.</p><p>After next year when the visuals are out, it looks like more tours. I’m super excited- one of the reasons [is because] the way I recorded it uses a lot of the highlife influences. Culturally it’s a lot of call and response type of music. In Ghana if you go to the villages, it’s such that when someone sings, the crowd responds. It’s community based music. So I’m excited to get on the road and perform this album as much as possible. I think a lot of people will understand the music more when it’s performed on stage. I think down the road it looks like a lot more shows and music, maybe just getting myself in other roles. A lot of people don’t know I produce, that’s the thing…. I love to produce for other artists and send music out.</p><p><strong>Kobi Onyame will be performing at The Poetry Club/SW3G in Glasgow on December 2, 2017 and The Waiting Room in London, 1 February 2018. His most recent studio album <em>Gold</em> is out now.</strong></p>",

      "title": "Edinburgh Short Film Festival: Day 5",
      "html": "<p>The fifth night of the <strong>Edinburgh Short Film Festival</strong> was a collection of short documentaries, all exploring the back-alleys of identity, group mentality and anonymity. With five of the seven films based in Scotland, the audience expected a distinctly more comfortable ‘home-turf’ feel to the evening. All of the films, however, approached the genre of documentary in equally surprising and engaging ways, to deliver a beautifully crafted peek into the lifestyles and obstacles of many varying characters in a contemporary society.</p><p>The night opened with ‘<strong>Ma Bar</strong>’. Winner of the BAFTA Scotland Best Short Film back in 2009, the film documents the obsessive lifestyle followed by Bill McFadyen, the 73 year old world champion bench presser from a small town on the south-west coast of Scotland. Using almost entirely close-up facial shots and accompanied by snippets of Bill’s own narration, the film is intimately moulded around the bodily and mental extremes which some are determined to achieve. Very engaging yet at times unsettling, ‘Ma Bar’ creates a well-crafted juxtaposition of aesthetic pleasure and the shock factor of human endeavour.</p><p>‘<strong>Commodity City</strong>’ stood out for its sheer originality, beautiful shots and sense of humour. One of the two international films of the evening, it has been screened worldwide and has won various short documentary prizes. Set in the world’s largest wholesale market in the Chinese city of Yiwu, the audience is given a beautiful 11 minute insight into the life of the stall owners whom we daily take for granted. The sellers, full of life and individuality, are isolated in their own cubicle stalls, set against an oppressive backdrop of cheap pens, toys and hairdryers. A sombre man in charge of a pen shop takes care to painstakingly count metal parts on his desk; an elderly lady sweet talks one of her customer, insulting and complimenting him at the same time; a woman shouts at her son for hitting another child on the head with a toy. With barely any dialogue and the continuum of tinny mall music playing in the background, ‘Commodity City’ presents a seamless montage of individual shots which individually seem insignificant on the surface, but which combine to take on new weight and meaning; a brilliant film.</p><p>Also Scottish-themed, '<strong>The Big Lie</strong>’ skilfully weaves in historical events with contemporary issues and trends. An interview with one of the last surviving members of the Scottish International Brigades forms the template for the film, through which we learn about the hundreds of Scottish men and women who, between 1936-39, volunteered to fight for the Spanish Republic against the fascist regimes of Hitler and Mussolini. The big lies that Fascists weave into society come to the fore in the course of the film, as well as the stupidity of the masses in following. The well-crafted interview is cleverly combined with original historical footage, and slowly climaxes to turn the focus back around at the end of the film; the significance of mass media and the redefinition of truth is, sadly, just as relevant almost 100 years later.</p><p>‘<strong>The Devil and the Holy Water</strong>’ also explores human extremes. Shot on location in Addis Abeba, Ethiopa, anthropologist Diego Malara sheds light on the power held by controversial exorcism priest Mehmer Girma, whose charisma draws hundreds from across the country. Narrated entirely by a woman who has herself been exorcised by Girma, we watch individuals screaming and writhing as Girma, standing on a stage and equipped with a microphone, forces the devil to reveal itself. With close-up intimate shots that often last longer than would ordinarily be comfortable, ‘The Devil and the Holy Water’ reveals the shocking reality of contemporary exorcism practice with a distinctly eerie feel.</p><p>All in all, the short documentary night of the <strong>ESFF</strong> was an extremely interesting evening, at times shocking and at others very funny, and offered intimate glances into seven very different realities. A common theme developed as the films merged into a collective, one of appreciating the difficulties surrounding identities in a contemporary world; yet these are difficulties we must respond to whilst holding together rather than dividing.</p>",

Screen time is split between shots of an animated fictional story and documentary footage of the story’s creation.</p><p>The animation tells the story of Liyana, a young Swazi girl who loses both of her parents to AIDS, and then loses her two twin brothers to kidnappers. Encouraged by her grandmother, Liyana embarks on a perilous journey to rescue her brothers from their kidnappers. On the way, Liyana must battle fearsome beasts and face hunger and exhaustion, with her faithful bull as her only companion.</p><p>Nigerian-born visual artist Shofela Coker creates an animation of stunning detail; the images are rich with colour and texture. The story is a classic tale of a heroic protagonist on a treacherous journey. As an animation alone, this story would be a gripping and uplifting children’s story, but it is its origins which deepen its meaning.</p><p>Documentary footage of the creation of Liyana’s story is interwoven with the story itself. In the form of one-on-one interviews and footage of story-telling workshops, the audience gains insight into a unique kind of story-telling therapy. Sibusiso, Zweli, Phumlani, Nomcebo, Mkhuleko, a group of (mostly male) children at <i>Likhaya Lemphilo Lensha</i> home for orphans, are guided by South African author and story-teller Gcina Mhlophe to create a story which in many ways mirrors their own experiences of life in Swaziland.</p><p><i>Liyana</i> is a story made by children, but its central themes are far from typical for a children’s story. <i>Liyana</i> experiences first-hand the traumas of alcoholism, rape, kidnapping and AIDS. The film illuminates the harsh reality of living in a country in which 25% of adults in Swaziland have HIV.</p><p>In the Q&amp;A which followed the Filmhouse screening of <i>Liyana</i>, the directors Aaron and Amanda Kopp pointed out that the creators of <i>Liyana </i>may not have been entirely aware of the complexity of the metaphors in their own story. While this may be true of some of the film’s more subtle meaning, the children who created the story seem to be aware of the relevance of gender in Swaziland. In the Q&amp;A, Aaron retold the response to a question which was asked to the children at the Los Angeles world premiere of <i>Liyana. </i>The children were asked why they chose a female protagonist for their story, in light of the fact that the 11 year old age group at the time of filming was predominantly male. In response, one of the boys answered that it made sense, because most of the struggles in Africa are faced by women.</p><p><i>Liyana</i> represents an 8 year long labour of love, which has been condensed into 75 glorious minutes. <i>Liyana</i> triumphs in its conviction to avoid stereotypical portrayals of African orphans, and ultimately offers a different kind of narrative by giving Sibusiso, Zweli, Phumlani, Nomcebo, Mkhuleko a microphone with which to amplify their voices.</p>",

Although just 65 minutes long, its brazen depiction of an intensely toxic relationship leaves the audience exhausted.</p><p>The play opens with Jo and Harry, played by Cassandra Cassidy and Sam Coade, having sex and watching porn. Jo is evidently disinterested, eating Wotsits and not looking at Harry. It’s a shocking image, and one that captures the outrageous yet dispassionate play nicely.</p><p>‘The One’ takes place over the course of a single night, as Jo and Harry wait for news of Jo’s sister, who is in labour. The real tension begins when Kerry, one of Harry’s colleagues - it later emerges that both Harry and Kerry taught Jo at university - turns up uninvited, declaring that her boyfriend has raped her.</p><p>Jo’s reaction is appallingly cruel, questioning and laughing at Kerry's claim, before announcing that Kerry is the true rapist because she did not say no or push her boyfriend away. Jo’s attitude is clearly an extreme example of the way society consistently undermines victims of sexual violence; she’s immediately categorised as a vindictive bully, and the horrifying product of rape culture.</p><p>However, things are not quite that straightforward.</p><p>The power that Jo seems to hold swiftly dissipates as Harry declares that he does ‘things like that’ to her ‘all the time’.</p><p>As the play progresses, the audience are forced to constantly question Jo and Harry’s relationship: do they even like each other or are they just lying and taunting their way through the evening? Harry appears to be controlling and abusive, although to what extent he is acting out Jo’s fantasies is not clear.</p><p>The power balance between the two swings wildly, and it is sometimes hard to keep up. The actors cope well with the constantly changing dynamics. Jo spends the entire play dressed only in lacy underwear, which makes her seem both incredibly vulnerable and intimidatingly confident at the same time. One of the most shocking moments of the play is a somewhat gratuitous rape fantasy scene, especially as it is not clear whether or not it is consensual.</p><p>Consent and power in relationships are the main themes of ‘The One’, and it certainly encourages the audience to reflect on the way that we deal with these issues in society. However, what exactly it is trying to say about these issues is not that clear. This was by no means the fault of the actors, who dealt very well with the intense script, which had the potential to seem exaggerated.</p><p>‘The One’ is a play that opens up difficult questions without providing easy answers. It forces the audience to consider them, but refuse to lay down a blueprint for how we should go about it.</p>",

Following a great set from ones-to-watch support act, Zeals, The Hoosiers deliver a night of nostalgic throwbacks to better times (the cherished late 00s). With their famous single ‘Worried About Ray’ getting the crowd belting along right from the start, they bravely decide to drop ‘Goodbye Mr A’ relatively early, before ploughing through all the favourites from their first album.</p><p><br>Several forgotten gems stand out, including the acoustic ‘Everything Goes Dark’. They explaining that the song is an exploration of mental illness, which gives the lyrics new, thought-provoking meaning. Between songs singer Irwin Sparkes entertains the crowd with what can only be described as slightly awkward dad banter, reflecting perhaps that the Hoosiers golden days are indeed back in a previous decade, yet the band clearly perform with the same warm nostalgic enthusiasm as the audience, and they certainly get the crowd dancing. In a time when cheesy pop-rock is almost obsolete, and heavy bass-ridden big-name DJs dominate the industry, it is lovely to sing along to silly songs about superheroes and ‘Cops and Robbers’ once again, and remember a band the majority of the audience would have grown up with. Having seen The Hoosiers myself when I was 12 (my first ever gig!) the night is particularly heartwarming.</p><p>After finishing the set, the band return with a lengthy encore, no longer sticking to the first album. This is where the band are able to showcase their true technical abilities. Perhaps the most memorable song of the show was an excellent and unexpected cover of the Weeknd’s ‘Can’t Feel My Face’, performing a psychedelic, guitar-heavy, slower version that works excellently. The full, impressive range of Sparkes’s vocals were put on show here as he breaks into a powerful falsetto, and the extended guitar solo brings on cheers from the crowd. Once again, it is lovely to see the band clearly having a lot of fun onstage, the anniversary tour absolutely coming about due to a love of performing and a wish to revisit, perhaps for the last time, the success that dominated their early career. As Sparkes joked, ‘you can buy our merch, or not, we don’t need the money!’.</p><p><br>Ultimately, the evening is a fun, nostalgic, cheesy night for band and audience, with their final song ‘Choices’ leaving people singing down the street after the gig. Their sound might not quite have caught up with this decade, but no-one can deny the deserved success of <em>The Trick to Life-</em> the album that catapulted The Hoosiers to fame 10 years ago.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/Rs6E_hg8tR.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The Alehouse Sessions, led by violinist and curator Bjarte Eike, feels like walking into a 17<sup>th</sup> century English pub. English sea shanties and Scandinavian folk songs fill the room to transport the audience back in time- or so reads the online description of the event. Interesting, unique, an interactive musical experience – all enticing buzzwords, but at the end of the day there’s only so much excitement the phrase “17<sup>th</sup> century tavern” can evoke.</p><p>Skepticism aside, the seven men need only a few bars to convince the audience they are in the right place – or that they are about to be. Most people attending sit at tables in the oval room sipping on a beer or cider. Others sit around the edges. Performers nearly hit someone’s grandma in the head with their guitar neck. They make clear this will be more of a jam session than a performance, more of a sharing of musical space than a demonstration of arranged works.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/kIRMZaYs80.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>It is hard not to lose track of time in St. Cecilia’s hall. High-tempo fiddle-heavy songs follow somber tunes from a violist whose eerie yet beautiful tenor voice scarcely fills the room. Some songs are formal compositions, others are informal pub chants; calls and responses evoking a pub-song session. Halfway through the show, a performer – this guy really does seem like someone plucked him from a sailor’s pub in the late 1600s – takes the audience through his depiction of the four types of drunkards, theatrically demonstrating what vomiting into the underside of a Djembe drum might look like. His bandmates cringe; the audience roars with laughter.</p><p>Along with a great stage presence, every performer quietly shows incredible musicianship. Aside from a percussionist using a Djembe (vomit-free) and a bass drum, the group is mostly stringed instruments. The front man is on violin, along with a violist. Two guitarists seem to mix Spanish-classical fingering with more traditional folk strumming. The bass player sends low-frequency pulses with subtle plucks, but the room shakes with his deep bowing strokes. A keyboardist trades off between a harpsicord and an accordion-like organ – evoking an orchestra behind the other strings.</p><p>The Alehouse Sessions is musical, but it is just as much a story, a song, a dance, and a drink. I don't lose my hearing like I might at a rock concert, but the group’s energy level is high enough to give anyone a second wind and make for a lovely evening out. The intermission stampede to get more beer on the next street over doesn't hurt either.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/1cq0_z6W3i.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/ONR3ofQnnq.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><b>Elliot Bryant sits down with Louis Berry to discuss his tour, his sound, and the key to being a successful artist.</b></p><p><b>How’s the tour going so far?</b></p><p>Really good – I’m tired, but it’s been good. We’re doing venues a lot smaller than what we can do now but I think it’s important to go to these cities when people can’t always reach the big cities like Glasgow. Obviously, Edinburgh’s on this one, it’s a little bit different, but in England we’ve been doing cities like Coventry and Dover, places you wouldn’t usually go, so it’s been interesting.</p><p><b>How would you compare performing at a small intimate venue to a larger one? Which do you prefer?</b></p><p>I like both, I like the big venues, the bigger the crowds the better for me. I love that, but at the same time, doing smaller, more intimate venues, keeps your head in the game - it takes you back to when you started.</p><p><b>You’ve released several successful singles, what’s next and how long will you keep fans waiting for the album?</b></p><p>The next single will far exceed the other ones before it - there’s been a bit of a delay putting a new single out as some people may have noticed, but it’s all for good reasons. We’ve been making sure everything is right and I’ve rerecorded tracks twice in two different studios to make them sound right. Also, I’m doing some collaborations with other artists, I won’t mention any names, but quite well-known artists which is exciting, and the album will be out early next year.</p><p><b>You’re a versatile artist, what sort of sound will the album have?</b></p><p>Well I think anyone can get on that stage and just smash those cymbals and just say ‘this is indie music’. That’s easy – I could do that in my sleep. I think it’s important to do the rock-n-roll stuff and then also be able to showcase another side and show that I can write these slow songs, these ballads.</p><p><b>How would you describe your approach to writing? Do you need to be proactive or is it more of a natural process?</b></p><p>I write every day unless I’m on tour - if I’m on tour I’m too tired. I don’t think about it too much though, for me it’s a duty to write - I have to write. I’ll wake up and go do a few hours in the gym and then I’ll go home and then I’ll literally write all night. It’ll take me anywhere between five minutes and an hour to write a song - I used to be a lot quicker, but now I think about it a little bit more. Obviously when you start working with bigger producers, and have better studios and better musicians you learn a lot and you have to become a little more methodical which I don’t like, but it is necessary at times.</p><p><b>You said you’ve been writing for other artists as well, is that something you enjoy or do you prefer writing for your own music?</b></p><p>I enjoy all aspects of writing - I write songs for girls and things like that you know what I mean? I think it’s important, as I said, to showcase different styles of writing and that for me is what an artist is. I’m trying to be an artist- I don’t want to be a performer. I don’t want to stand there singing someone else’s songs and lie to people that are paying money for gigs- that’s not what I’m about. So I’ll write a song that’s true to me and if people like it, they like it and if they don’t, they don’t - as long as it’s honest.</p><p><b>It’s refreshing to see you up there with just your guitar, do you think it’s a problem with the industry that more and more artists are going up on stage with laptops and other electronic equipment?</b></p><p>I hate it. People are paying money for gig tickets and they’re coming to watch a live performance. I’d say 80% - even more, 90% of bands I’ve seen on the road have got some kind of backing track playing. People who haven’t got a trained ear to that kind of thing won’t always notice it but I’ve been at festivals or touring with people and they’ve been on the stage and I’ve heard these vocals coming out yet no one’s on stage yet! I can’t do that, I have to be honest with the fans musically.</p><p><b>Which artists do you admire at the moment?</b></p><p>I don’t know you, you know… There’s aspects that I like of lots of different artists. I like a lot of American artists and I’m into my rap and things like that, that’s the kind of background I come from. It’s just by chance that I fell into making guitar music. I like the likes of J. Cole, I think he’s a really honest writer and he’s great at what he does. In terms of British artists, I think that Sam Smith is great; I’ve got the same producer and I’ve heard some of Sam’s stuff before it’s out and honestly all I can say is that people are really gonna love it. It’s really good music. We’re using the same gospel singers and things like that on some of the tracks and I’m excited to hear all of his stuff when it comes out. I think he’s a great artist.</p><p><b>Tell me the story of your grandad’s guitar and how you discovered music.</b></p><p>Well my grandfather plays the guitar, but he only plays three chords - he’ll play you any song with those three chords though. He had a guitar at the bottom of his bed, and I wasn’t allowed to touch it but I had a little go. I still remember the first four chords I played – funnily enough I’ve never written a song with those chords but I should do, I was thinking about it the other day. Anyway, I showed him that I could play the guitar and he bought me a banjo! He said \"play a banjo, everyone plays the guitar\" and \"you'll go further with a banjo\". But you can't write rock n roll songs on a banjo so I switched back over to the guitar.</p><p><b>Where do you think you'd be if that moment hadn't happened? Has music been important to you in terms of keeping you out of trouble as you were growing up?</b></p><p>Yeah, it's kept me out of trouble, even now being grown up. The background I'm from is not a normal background of the people that get into music or even people in my band - they're coming out of universities or things like that. It’s a great thing for them to learn aspects of music in that way but I’m from a completely different route, I was a criminal before I got involved in music and music gave me my only avenue away from that lifestyle so I'm very grateful to be here doing what I'm doing.</p><p><b>What have you learnt so far from being in the industry and what advice would you give to an aspiring young artist?</b></p><p>Well don’t let people change your minds that’s what I’d say, but who am I to say? I’m no expert here. I’m still trying to achieve what I need to achieve, and when I do achieve that, maybe I’ll have a little bit more advice. I’ve got a lot to learn.</p><p>But I think just stay true to yourself, don’t let anyone change your mind or persuade you in any way and don’t try and sound like other artists. I hear so many bands trying to sound like other people, but by the time you’ve released that stuff you’ve copied off a band you like, that band will be old news. So, it’s pointless - times change fast. When I started with this sound, you know it’s like a rock-n-roll sound, people think it can be compared to older stuff, but if I told you it was gunna be getting 'hottest record' on Radio 1 and things like that you would’ve laughed at me. That single was played on Radio 1 and it’s rock-n-roll music - anything’s possible if you stay true to yourself.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/XDnvndUWdt.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><b>Reviewed by Anna Staufenberg and Issey Medd</b></p><p>The second night of the <strong>Edinburgh Short Film Festival</strong> at Summerhall was based on the theme of ‘Secret Selves’, and featured ten short films from a diverse range of countries. Each film presented a short and often humorous insight into assorted secret selves, hidden habits and mysterious goings-on, tackling the theme in original and innovative ways, and providing an array of moving and very human narratives.</p><p>The screening opened with the Swedish film ‘<strong>People in Cars</strong>’, which slowly builds up 6 separate stories. The film focuses on the truth of human relationships, beautifully presented through the perspective of people whilst in transit, an in-between space that is at the same time highly personal. The conversations all follow a similar narrative of a hidden secret being tentatively brought out into the open. For example, a young hipster’s love for his engaged best friend, or a mother learning of her son’s secret online girlfriend from the Philippines. The cleverly executed dialogue allows the tension to rise and peak almost imperceptibly. At times extremely funny and at others slightly awkward, People in Cars is a beautiful snapshot of the secrets of individuals, and how they are revealed to those closest to them.</p><p>‘<strong>Princess</strong>’, from German filmmaker Noëmi Schneider, tackles the issue of gender identity, following a young boy who is involved in a group of smoking, mask-cladded bullies. Busted by his next-door neighbour and victim, who catches him dancing in the mirror in makeup and a dress, they begin a friendship based on bribery and exchange. He will help her train for a dance competition and she won’t expose his secret self. The film movingly explores the collision between the boy’s need to emphasise his masculinity - impressing his father and aggressive friends – and the secret femininity that is connected to his lost mother.</p><p>Nominated for best foreign film at the LA independent film festival, ‘<strong>Victor</strong>’ was another ingenious take on a secret identity, with a surprising twist at the end. Paul Menville’s French thriller follows a mysterious man who drives around a deserted town, picking up women on an apparent murder spree. In black and white, the mood is sombre and dramatic. At gas stations, in bars, and in the stairwell of his apartment he interacts with three different women, and reflects on his deep love for a girl who pops up everywhere he goes. One particularly memorable scene, he finds himself in the town bar, sitting among a fantastic array of alternative punk characters who sit smoking, drinking and staring wearily into the distance. Then towards the end, Menville skilfully reveals the true complexity of this man’s secret self, forcing the viewer to look back over the interactions portrayed throughout the film in a new light – a brilliant film!</p><p>The British film ‘<strong>EWWW</strong>’ stood out for its sheer humour and original take on the theme of secret selves. It opens halfway through a date that is coated in awkwardness, overcompensated for with excellently acted and slightly manic laughter on the girl’s part, who starts bombarding her date with Google’s top first date questions. The snappy dialogue is extremely well-written and appeals to a more British sense of humour, which delights in the awkward. We watch as the girl dares him to tell her his biggest secret, and her resultant wide eyes as he whispers something in her ear. We then find ourselves in the guy’s apartment, the mood taking a slightly more sinister turn as the man’s secret remains undisclosed. The girl slips out of bed as he sleeps and sneaks a look at his DVDs - which is where the truth of his secret self is documented. Like so many of the short films over the course of the evening, the secret that is revealed is not at all what the audience expects; the tension breaks and the sheer ingenuity of the storyline shocks us into ending the film laughing.</p><p>Catalina Jordan’s film ‘<strong>Paco</strong>’ was another highlight of the evening. Winner of best picture at Fantastic Fest in Austin, the experimental and quite bizarre story centres around a man who sits in the park calling at passers-by. Visually the film is exciting, colourful and autumnal and the execution of this strange narrative, these peculiar yet affirming interactions with a man in a park, is excellent. The film is daring, hilarious and beautiful.</p><p>Overall ‘<strong>Secret Selves</strong>’ was a fantastic evening; the selection of films had a really international feel, showcasing a series of eclectic, imaginative and creative stories that were at once entirely relatable yet totally bizarre.</p><p><strong>'Secret Selves' was part of the <a href=\"http://www.edinburghshortfilmfestival.com/2017-programme/\">Edinburgh Short Film Festival,</a> which runs until 11th November 2017.</strong></p>",

      "html": "<p><strong>Reviewed by Carly Beeher</strong></p><p>Monkey Barrel Comedy club on a Sunday night and the crowd was nearly full. ‘Slashers Prefer Blondes’, the improv-comedy-horror-movie, was very well received at both last year’s Edinburgh Horror Festival and the Fringe Festival, and was about to take the stage once more.</p><p>Three of the members of the comedy troupe ‘Everyone Gets a Trophy’ begin the show with an introduction to improv comedy and their goal to create a completely improvised horror movie. With crowd participation they begin to create the bones of what would become the performance. When asked what scared them as kids the crowd replies with things such as ‘spiders’, ‘clowns’, and ‘basements’. It is put to an audience vote, and ‘basements’ are chosen as the basis of the upcoming show. The next task posed to the crowd is that of naming a scary place. One audience member loudly voiced “France!”. Everyone bursts into laughter and so the show is titled ‘Basements in France’.</p><p>The ‘movie’ begins with a young woman Tabitha (played by Mike Gorman) getting ready to go on a date with her boyfriend Chad. She is having snarky banter with her great pal, Alexa the artificial intelligence console (played by William Matthew Knapp). Alexa provides the smarts that Tabitha is lacking. Lapping up the witty female back-and-forth, the crowd is quickly laughing hard.</p><p>The boyfriend Chad (played by Lance Fuller) soon comes into the scene and initiates a series of phallic-based jokes. It is made clear that Chad does not live up to girlfriend Tabitha’s standards. Rips on Chad continue throughout the show, never failing to entertain.</p><p>The couple then sets off to France, where they get into a plane crash. In the crash both Tabitha and Alexa are completely fine, while Chad is turned into an unknown monster that loves both blood and brains. Zombie or Vampire? This is made clear when the ‘movie’ ends with the French legalization of Zombie-Human marriage.</p><p>Jokes at the expense of the French were prevalent. Alexa’s settings got stuck in multiple languages, and the relationships only got funnier. All improvised yet not a single joke failed to land. The energy was high throughout the performance, and the crowd provided enthusiastic laughter throughout. The talent of the trio of men was evident and appreciated. All accolades earned by this group were well deserved.</p><p>Do you worry this review spoiled the show? Don’t! – it’s improv! With a new title every performance, a totally new show is created every time. I would recommend catching ‘Everyone Gets a Trophy’ next time they’re in town!</p><p>‘Slashers Prefer Blondes’ performed in the 2017 Edinburgh Horror Festival Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday.</p><p>For more info about the Edinburgh Horror Festival, visit: <a href=\"https://www.edhorrorfest.co.uk/about\">www.edhorrorfest.co.uk/about</a></p>",

A second generation Italian American couple and their orphaned niece are tested by the arrival of the wife’s cousins from the homeland. Marco and Rodolpho have come to Brooklyn to seek their fortune and fulfil the American dream, but find the land of the free oppresses its citizens in ways that will be darkly revealed.</p><p>It’s become a bit of a cliché to relate any American narrative to current events across the Pond, but it’s hard to resist drawing parallels between this explosive portrayal of fragile masculinity and the despotic figures currently occupying our headline space. Taking on the role of the play’s antihero, Eddie, Paddy Echlin’s command of the stage was an extraordinary exploration of obsession and control, sensitively negotiated against Eleanor Crowe’s sweet and hopeful Catherine. They were joined in their family unit by Tilly Botsford as Beatrice. These three actors worked together to gradually push a strained domestic dynamic to its limits, and to reveal the tension growing out of everything left unsaid.</p><p>Henry Coldstream and Leo Sartain played the Italian cousins whose arrival in Brooklyn changes everything. Whilst the object of Catherine’s romantic desire, Rodolpho, was portrayed with a sinister charm, Sartain’s reserved and controlled energy in his approach to Marco was carefully considered. He could have easily fallen victim to stereotyping the character with overplayed caricatures of an Italian native, but he negotiates the parameters of the role with a graceful maturity.  Although never quite slipping into the realm of unfiltered testosterone, the stage space bubbled and simmered with the fragility of the characters’ masculinity and the claustrophobia of a neighbourhood where everybody talks.</p><p>The costumes and set were both excellent, with the exposed living room working to illustrate the tension between interior and exterior that finally explodes in the play’s second act; the whole crew should be praised for their creative manipulation of the stage space. The characters that periodically invaded the home space to invite Eddie bowling provided an excellent framing device, charting the patriarch’s loss of control and descent into obsession.</p><p>Despite holding its own amongst the most professional of Bedlam plays that I’ve seen, the shifting locale of the action is tricky to pull off. The suggestion of the other ‘submarine’ characters, the immigrants who had arrived ‘underwater’ from Italy to live upstairs from the family, were rushed and seemed like an afterthought.  Similarly, Miller’s inclusion of a chorus figure Alfieri, played conservatively but authentically by Peter Morrison, was at times disconnected and lacked the sense of authority necessary for a narrative role.</p><p>Overall, though, the production successfully brought the streets of Brooklyn to life. Those tricky American accents were held with relative ease and the tone was controlled throughout, resulting in a chilling but ultimately satisfying climax. Andra Gavin as director has handled Arthur Miller’s mastery of tension with maturity and sensitivity.</p>",

We’re in a rather innocuous seminar room at Glasgow’s Queen Margaret Union, where tonight’s gig seems at odds with the whiteboard and stark lighting.  As it turns out, he’s extremely nice, and despite it being my first interview and the audio recorder’s failure (we used my phone), he’s consistently charming. When I mention the fact it’s my first, fiddling with his giant skull ring, he offers a game: if he guesses my question, I can’t ask it. How can I not accept? The twelve minutes of the interview go by before I even notice, and I find myself apologising for taking his time, and - most bizarrely - wishing him good luck. This too, when the foremost impression I got was just how assured and at home Faris seemed, even in this weird seminar room an hour before performing.</p><p>The performance itself is fantastic. Preceded by half an hour of brilliant, twisted, psych-rock from support Baba Naga (from whom I’d have equally loved a full set), The Horrors launch into a heavy, tight and confident set. 'Machine', <em>V</em>''s first single, arrives early and hard, where 'Something to Remember Me By' closes out, rightfully claiming status as an anthem. The same aggression that Faris mentions having missed in the interview is out in full force: favourites such as 'Still Life' still make an appearance, of course, but in a darker and slightly uptempo fashion that whips up the crowd. If you have the opportunity, their show is not one to miss.</p><p>The Horrors’ album<em> V </em>is out now on Wolf Tone/Caroline International.</p><p><strong>Dominic</strong>: Do you wanna guess your first?</p><p><strong>Faris</strong>: Ok, so.. What were your influences on this record?</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Yeah, that was was the obvious one!</p><p><strong>F</strong>: Ah, well we can strike that one out then. Why the change from Luminous to V, why the change in sound? Is that one?</p><p><strong>D</strong>: No</p><p><strong>F</strong>: No?</p><p><strong>D</strong>: I’m gonna ask a similar one though, so.. Is V a return to that more gothic noise, or has it always been there?</p><p><strong>F</strong>: Well, I always thought that our live shows were a lot more aggressive than our records - even on the first album - because, I mean when you listen to live recordings, of us playing the first record, it’s almost un-listenable. I mean it’s like.. It’s just a f*cking screeching mess. You know, In this.. I mean I f*cking hate musicians so that’s fine, but it’s like.. I don’t like people who can - who’ve learnt to play their instruments in a conventional way - I like people who’ve picked up the instrument, and they’ve kind of been inspired to do something else with it - even if that means making a complete racket. So I’m into that. But yeah I mean I was singing twice as fast as everyone else was playing, it was a mess! But yeah, like I said, I enjoy that. So, on this record, it kind of felt like we’d gone so long without… aggression, that, we wanted a bit of it back.</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Do you wanna continue the game?</p><p><strong>F</strong>: What did Paul Epworth bring to your new record, V?</p><p><strong>D</strong>: No.</p><p><strong>F</strong>: No? Jeez, ok, You’re ahead, you’re ahead</p><p><strong>D</strong>: I’m ahead?</p><p><strong>F</strong>: 2 to 1</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Do you have any pre-gig rituals that you guys always go to?</p><p><strong>F</strong>: Pre gig rituals… I did, well, I do.. I got this inhaler that - Have you seen blue velvet? Ok, well Blue Velvet, Dennis Hopper, makes his return to the big screen, after some, after a period of.. wilderness, and he’s got this mask that he puts over his mouth like this [he mimes] and he kind of.. he sounds really terrifying, so I’ve got a mask that I put over my face to inhale steam, and then that steam warms up my voice, and since then I haven’t lost my voice - that’s the closest thing I have to a ritual. Josh [Guitarist] just sleeps for an hour.</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Nice, that - that’s really impressive, like I had no idea that that would..</p><p><strong>F</strong>: No, I thought actually, I dunno why more.. I’m sure singers do it, I’m sure lots of people do it, otherwise it wouldn’t exist, but I thought I want to design one that’s one, that’s made of one piece, ‘cause I thought.. it’s not - the top bit melts, sometimes</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Yeah - how do you do that, just got a kettle, and you’re like huffing?</p><p><strong>F</strong>: No, it’s a little beaker, you know those ones you have when you’re a kid that, that right themselves if you knock them over? It’s a bit like that, and it’s got a plastic mouthpiece, but yeah.</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Nice… Another one?</p><p><strong>F</strong>: OK… Alright well this will be the end of your interview, if you ask it: What can we expect from the upcoming tour, with The Horrors?</p><p><strong>D</strong>: No</p><p><strong>F</strong>: [laughs]</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Told you I’m bad at this</p><p><strong>F</strong>: No no, it means you’re good, this is a good thing. I’m supposed to lose, and I’ll be happy, if I lose, I’m happy.</p><p><strong>D</strong>: If you were dictator, what would your first law be?</p><p><strong>F</strong>: Brilliant, that’s great, never had that one. First law… ok… well, I mean the thing is, you know, you say something and then probably later on think of something more important. But…</p><p><strong>D</strong>: It’s only your first, it doesn’t have to be the most important</p><p><strong>F</strong>: You’re right, I know, but if I was dictator I’d want to make a statement.. Yeah I dunno, I think I’d probably make.. Yeah am I dictator of the world?</p><p><strong>D</strong>: World is fine.</p><p><strong>F</strong>: Did you know that in Ireland, certain parts, abortion is not legal? That’s crazy.</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Yeah..</p><p><strong>F</strong>: And you get more time in jail, if you get raped and abort the child, than you do if you’re raping someone. How crazy is that? So…</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Yeah, that’s - that’s nuts.</p><p><strong>F</strong>: Yeah. So I’d probably do something to do with women’s rights. Abortion is legal, everyone.</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Nice. If you weren’t doing this, i.e. being [lead singer of] The Horrors, I mean, what would you be doing, do you think? Still down south?</p><p><strong>F</strong>: I definitely wouldn’t be where I grew up.. I think.. I was studying to be an architect, and I didn’t ever really think about it, so I kind of.. I dunno, it’s weird how you sort of find your level, eventually, maybe you don’t, I dunno… But yeah, so I was studying illustration, and then I just ended up being away more and more, so I guess maybe a painter or something? I don’t know, I mean I paint a lot and I do exhibitions, maybe I’d do that. If it ended I’d do that. If it ended and I wasn’t allowed to make music, then I’d do that.</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Nice, have you got a favourite writing spot?</p><p><strong>F</strong>: I’m impressed, I like your questions ‘cause they’re really, they’re not boring… and honestly… the amount of boring questions… [laughs]</p><p><strong>D</strong>: I can imagine..</p><p><strong>F</strong>: Usually I start playing games to amuse myself, otherwise… Because I think it’s just a... a band is just a way to avoid boredom, more than anything else… It’s like, you wanna find a way in your life of having fun, and that’s what it is…  But yeah, writing spot, I dunno, I mean I have gone different places, we went, on this record, recently I went to iceland, because I’d spent two weeks trying to write one line of the lyrics, and I was going a bit mad - and it wasn’t even an important line - and I was just staring at a computer screen trying to do it, and it wasn’t happening, so we went to Iceland, and... we saw no-one the whole time, and we saw the northern lights... and yeah, we got the lyrics finished. So, I’d go back there. Sometimes I go to Manchester, which is a little different.</p><p><strong>D</strong>: If you walked into a record store now, and you were gonna pick up a record, old or new, what record would it be?</p><p><strong>F</strong>: Well I guess it would be one that I didn’t have, so… I feel like I have all the old bands, that you’d find in a record shop. I mean obviously not, but, you know, the more famous ones... So I’d probably, I feel like there’s a lot of new bands that I don’t know but I might like, ‘cause, we went to The Q Awards yesterday, and they had a ‘Best New Band’ category, and I realised I only knew half of them. And then... I was thinking that maybe... Because there are a lot of good new bands. There’s a band that I work with that’s called Happy Meal Ltd., I produced their first single, they’re really good. A bit like The Horrors when we started, but a lot more colourful. There’s this band that I’m working with called ‘Let’s Eat Grandma’, these two girls from Norwich, both... don’t think they’re 18 yet... but they’re on their second album.</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Damn, already?</p><p><strong>F</strong>: Yeah yeah, and they’re really good. ‘SOPHIE’? do you know the electronic music producer ‘SOPHIE’? Kind of started off with PC music, do you know those people?</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Afraid not, something to check out!</p><p><strong>F</strong>: Yeah well, there’s lots of stuff that I don’t know, so I’d go to a record store and pick up a sleeve that I liked, that I didn’t know. That’s what I’d do.  I think it’s rare to find a record sleeve that you really love, and completely hate the music, because it kind of goes with the aesthetic, yeah.</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Yeah</p><p><strong>F</strong>: Sort of, it’s not always true, but yeah I’d do that.</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Nice. The video for Something to Remember me by, that’s nuts, I’ve not seen a video like that in a long time...</p><p><strong>F</strong>: Well, you nearly saw two within the space of three weeks, because the band that I mentioned, Happy Meal Ltd., three days after our video came out, they got sent a treatment by a different director, that was almost word for word exactly the same as our video. They called me up and said they weren’t sure if it was coincidence (or if he just ripped it off), but yeah- so you could have seen two completely identical videos. But yeah I think the guy did a good job, Max Weiland. I’ve hated... I’ve had a problem with videos, for a long time, because I feel like we haven’t always had good ones. It’s hard being in a band of five people, because it ends up quite diplomatic, to the point where no-one gets what they want, so we’ve tried to be a little bit more… sort of... focused on different people’s opinions at different points.</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Sure, nice… The body horror aspects, I guess, of the video, and like the imagery for the new album, is that a new thing? Like is that something that’s suddenly popped up?</p><p><strong>F</strong>: Yeah, because I thought, I kinda felt like we got to a point where you would know what kind of sleeve to expect from The Horrors, and I was - we were all getting really bored of it, it just became this like… I dunno, I never even thought we were particularly a ‘psych band’ or whatever, in the traditional sense anyway, but we got that label. And all the psych bands have similar artwork, so, you know.. I felt it was a bit too comfortable. That was kind of the point with this new record, we felt like everything about the process had become too comfortable… so having something grotesque, and using CGI, which [we] haven’t done before... I just thought it was fun, you know, it’s kind of...</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Yeah, it’s new… Yeah I really liked all of the artwork and the videos, they’re really good.</p><p><strong>F</strong>: We’re trying to do an anime, for the next video, but.. Have you seen Ghost in the Shell? The guy who produced it got in touch and wanted to do a video, but then he said one minute of Ghost in the Shell cost £100,000 [laughs]</p><p><strong>D</strong>: No... Damn.</p><p><strong>F</strong>: Yeah, imagine how much the whole film cost, it’s crazy. So actually.. you know. That’s not going to happen. But we’re trying to find another way of doing it...</p><p><strong>D</strong>: Maybe collaboration... Anyway, thanks man, it’s really kind of you to give me the time.</p><p><strong>F</strong>: That’s alright, likewise, don’t mind at all.</p>",

Ethnic tensions characterise daily life. The Soviet invasion is imminent.</p><p>Against this tumultuous backdrop, Amir (David Ahmad) and his best friend Hassan (Jo Ben Ayed) spend their days running through the streets, reading quietly under pomegranate trees and of course, kite fighting.</p><p>Freshair recently had the chance to watch this turbulent period in Afghanistan’s recent past be brought to life on stage at the Kings Theatre, in Matthew Spangler’s adaptation of Khaled Hosseini’s best-selling novel<i>.</i></p><p>Although the historical context of the play is deftly conveyed through subtle costume changes that reflect Afghanistan’s shifting political landscape, at its heart, <i>The Kite Runner</i> is a story about friendship, courage and betrayal that any audience member can connect to.</p><p>David Ahmad, who plays the part of Amir, is particularly impressive in his ability to generate both reactions of disgust and empathy in the audience. After he betrays his close friend Hassan at a young age, the audience feels the full extent of the shame that chases him as he leaves Afghanistan to forge a new life in the US, and eventually forces him to return to his home country seeking redemption. Yet despite our despair at Amir’s behavior, Ahmad succeeds in maintaining the audience’s empathy as play’s narrator.</p><p>The choice to have the same actor play Amir as a child and as an adult is both effective and chilling, clearly showing us how the choices we make in our childhood can continue to haunt us later in life. Jo Ben Ayed is tremendous in his portrayal of the sweet and loyal Hassan and as a result it is impossible for the audience to remain unmoved by his tragic fate. Hanif Khan also merits a mention as the tabla player who performs live on stage throughout the show, which in addition to the use of traditional singing bowls, completely immerses the audience in the haunting world of <i>The Kite Runner</i>.</p><p>Emilio Doorgasingh in the part of Baba does a fantastic job at conveying how individual identity is challenged through the process of migration. Similarly, Amiera Darwish’s character Soraya, one of the few female parts in the play, successfully represents the struggle to balance traditional values with adaptation to a new society.</p><p>However, the love story between Soraya and Amir is ultimately unconvincing, as is the supposed tension between Amir, Hassan and their nemesis Assef (played by Bhavin Bhatt). Whilst the climax of their antagonistic relationship is incredibly painful to watch, the relationship both beforehand and after feels underdeveloped, with Assef playing the fool rather than the threatening and manipulative figure we are meant to believe.</p><p>Indeed, the play can feel rather unbalanced as a whole, with much of the action taking place in the last thirty minutes of a long performance. Yet fans of the book will be pleased, as this reflects the structure of Hosseini’s original novel and the adaptation is in general a very faithful one. However, the opportunity to be more creative with the plot’s structure and perhaps explore elements of the story that are not shown in the book, for example Hassan’s adulthood, was missed in this adaptation.</p><p>In spite of this, I defy anyone not to be moved by the story told. Many of the play’s most challenging themes are sadly poignant today. For example, when Amir and his father smuggle themselves out of Afghanistan, their whole life reduced to two suitcases, one is reminded of the huge numbers of refugees making similar journeys every day.</p><p>Overall, <i>The Kite Runner</i> is a visually and sonically impressive production that emphasises the importance of friendship. Although the play has many dark moments, it ultimately leaves the audience with hope for redemption. In contrast to Rahim Khan (Karl Seth)’s comment, ‘It was the two of us against the world, and the world won,’ <i>The Kite Runner</i> affirms that when we show courage, the bad guys don’t always have to win.</p><p><strong><em>'The Kite Runner' is touring throughout the UK until June 2018.

However, in this touring version, stylishly directed by Stephen Unwin, any emotional punches fall short.</p><p>Perhaps the 1982 script just hasn’t aged well – the political struggles that Henry so eloquently criticises is perfectly legitimised and praised in 2017. Increased awareness of intersectionality and inherent privilege mean that to a contemporary audience these characters appear less witty intellectuals, more unbearable stereotypes of champagne socialists and masculine elitism. Brodie, the anti-intellectual anarchist, was a slice of working class, Scottish comic relief. It was a misstep for the Edinburgh audience, as were the jokes about Glasgow.</p><p>It is not the fault of the actors, who manage to cajole a sense of realistic dialogue and genuine chemistry out of Stoppard’s dense script. Laurence Fox is an engaging lead, his delivery is spot on and the audience laugh right on cue – it’s hard not to be won over by his romance or self-deprecating humour. The other characters think so too; his wife, mistress and daughter (who, with her black lipstick and fishnets, is an embarrassingly inaccurate example of a teenage girl) might make long speeches about how snobbish his options, but he can silence them with a witty retort. The other, less educated men fade into the background, whilst Henry always comes out on top.</p><p>In a play supposedly about love, no one seems to even like each other. Many of the truest lines about love are lost in the rush to get to the next punchline. It’s a short play, and there was time to let the characters breathe a little, to allow some tenderness to seep through.</p><p>The greatest pity in this version is the wasted potential, the lack of courage in really engaging in what the play could be; a discussion between theatricality and reality. The lights stay up for the scene changes as if to suggest the characters are constantly in a play-within-a-play, but the actors slink off straight away, so it seems as if the technical team simply forgot to fade to blackout.</p><p>The result is a disjointed plot, where the audience are left struggling to piece together some deeper meaning. There is a sense of confusion and even disappointment at the painfully smug ending, as though for all of Henry’s agonising, all the broken hearts and soul-searching, none of it even mattered. Perhaps that is the point, but it does leave you with a sour taste in your mouth, as though the time invested by the audience was meaningless. ‘The Real Thing’ is often considered Stoppard’s first play with a real heart, yet in this version it barely has a pulse.</p><p><strong>'The Real Thing' will conclude its UK tour at <em>Theatre Royal,</em> Brighton: Mon 30th October 2017 to Sat 4th November 2017</strong></p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/afhVE_Etpu.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The mood before Corella’s set on Saturday is ambivalent at best. They are performing in the middle of a 3-band lineup; a Manchester band placed in-between two local bands both with large followings here in Edinburgh.</p><p>This skepticism from the crowd is emphasized by the fact that first band, Betty and the Bass, a small bluesy rock outfit, have just lit up the Voodoo Rooms. Corella starts playing to the small crowd- most of which are standing near the back. One might expect them to respond negatively to this initial lack of enthusiasm, especially after sold-out gigs throughout England, but they are surprisingly upbeat.</p><p>Live, the band’s pop-influenced indie-rock music becomes more rowdy and guitar-focused, letting the musical talent of the band members stand out. They energetically explore the instrumental parts of their songs, and their funky guitars and wild drumming make even the most cynical audience members want to dance.</p><p>In recordings, the vocals and pop melodies is what makes Corella’s songs stand out, and this holds true during their live show as well. A good example of their balance between energy and skillful songwriting is in their performance of ‘Waterfall’, their first single. The lyrics and the accompanying vocals are bubbly and uplifting, and the song performed by a different band could easily be made into a pop hit. Instead, Corella bring the guitar solo towards the end of the song into the forefront, letting the band’s gritty rock influences shine through. The lead singer, Joel, sings the lyrics with such intense passion and energy that it brings even more depth to the song.</p><p>What stands out more than the dynamic performance is that the band are engaging, kind, and most significantly, humble. At least three times towards the end of the set, Joel encourages the crowd to come talk to them about their music in the bar next door to the performance space. Many times more, he thanks the audience for being there and listening to their music.</p><p>It is important to note that Corella has every reason to be cocky. Their most recent single, ‘Barcelona Girl’, has been featured on Spotify’s “Indie Roadtrip” and “The Indie List” playlists and has over 300,000 plays on Spotify as of the writing of this review. They have achieved this without a full EP or even graduating from university, and somehow, in front of a small and unfamiliar audience, they put on an infectious live show. It will be exciting to see what they do next.</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/Yi4V5VuoTk.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Nick Mulvey is in a fine mood during his intimate gig at the Liquid Room in Edinburgh on Wednesday night. Propelled by the success of his brilliant and upbeat new album <em>Wake Up Now</em>, Mulvey treats his audience to an entertaining and moving set which boasts several new tracks, as well as favourites from his debut <em>First Mind</em>  which has already established him as a popular artist.</p><p>The talented London-based songwriter has a huge grin on his face when - midway through the show - the adoring crowd belt out the words to ‘Cucurucu’ with him. The intimacy of the night is again evident when Mulvey hears a drunken yell from an excited fan requesting him to play country classic ‘Look At Miss Ohio’. After laughing \"Miss Ohio?\" in response, he performs what is a simultaneously joyful and funny cover of the song, which is evident from the equally smiley audience. Mulvey is humble and doesn't seem to be taking himself too seriously, which makes him all the more likeable and causes the fans to really connect with him.</p><p>Before performing his new track ‘Myela’, written about the refugee crisis, Mulvey speaks of a need for big changes in the world. He says that refugees fleeing to Europe aren't just an issue we need to resolve but \"a message\" that we, as a society, need to hear. He claims the same is true for global warming, and that the hurricanes and earthquakes are also \"a message\" from the world that we need to make significant changes. A bucket for donations toward the refugee crisis is then passed around and filled with spare change. Although this slightly dampens the cheery mood of the crowd, it is a moving gesture that gives Mulvey’s songs deeper meaning which is so often lacking in today’s charts. The buzz of the crowd quickly returns when the singer and his band produce a special performance of 'Myela', before playing arguably his most recognisable hit ‘Fever To The Form’.</p><p>After walking off stage briefly, Mulvey returns to the delight of the audience to close the night with two fun and upbeat songs off his new album, ‘Transform Your Game’ and ‘Mountain To Move’. A large section of the crowd begins dancing and it is a positive finish to a successful and accomplished show. Mulvey makes a couple of noticeable mistakes in his guitar-playing, but these are certainly forgiven by his fans who are definitely not disappointed. Let’s hope Nick keeps his promise to return to Edinburgh \"very soon\"!</p>",

The sound of his limbs hitting the stage breaks the auditorium’s silence. The audience is tense, and even as Blanche is christened with an extravagant feather headpiece laughs are withheld. The uncommon sight of a visibly disabled actor commanding the stage leads to clenched jaws and held breath, and proves exactly why this play has been created and should be seen.</p><p>Set in the dressing room of a disabled, drag production of ‘Whatever Happened to Baby Jane’, the play’s narrative develops through squabbles, proclamations about identity and shared moments of glory – including an Abba number. Though the premise – breaking the fourth wall to reveal backstage antics – is nothing new, the show’s breaking down of social taboos should be commended.</p><p>The tension backstage builds to a breaking point when Bette forces Blanche to prove she cannot walk. This is depicted on stage, and perhaps unnecessarily. Drawn out, and with a foregone conclusion, instead of being gripped by the drama it left me waiting for it to reach the conclusion.</p><p>The laughter is hesitant to begin with. However, as the show progresses, the audience begins to relax, and to realise that yes, the show is funny; and yes, these ‘actually disabled’ actors are indeed capable of delivering unflinching jokes about ‘spaz-fucks’ and facials. The atmosphere in the auditorium swells towards a triumphant and hearty applause at the plays conclusion.</p><p>When the play isn’t telling our prejudiced concept of disability to ‘F*** Off’ (the concluding statement from Robert’s searing monologue), it encourages the audience to engage in reflection – sometimes quite literally. At one point, whilst the characters inspect their appearance in on stage mirrors, glints of the audience are mixed with their reflections. Garry Robson’s Butch delivers touching thoughts on his role as a father, and Kinny Gardner’s Bette laments the passage of time. The audience, meanwhile, are faced with their own voyeuristic gaze reflected back at them, a powerful reminder of our own capacity to ‘Other’ someone with just a look. It is a thought that stays with you long after the play’s curtain.</p><p>It is also worth noting that with both a sign interpreter and a teleprompter for the hearing impaired, this story of intersectionality is accessible to all.</p><p><em>For more information about Birds of Paradise Theatre Company, head to their website: <a href=\"http://www.boptheatre.co.uk/\">http://www.boptheatre.co.uk/</a></em></p>",

Ten years since he burst onto the music scene with the ever-sunny ‘Dream Catch Me’ way back in 2007, the ginger-haired singer-songwriter has now shred his once famous dreadlocks and recently released his sixth studio album, <em>Hit the Ground Running</em>. Last week Laura Hendry got to chat to him about his new music and upcoming tour.</b></p><p><b>You can catch Newton playing in Edinburgh at The Liquid Rooms on 28th October.</b></p><p><b>So, whereabouts are you right now Newton? Are you currently in the UK?</b><br>I’m currently in a taxi just going across London - I’m going from North London to East London.</p><p><b>You’re playing a gig in Edinburgh in a few weeks time at The Liquid Rooms - have you played here before? </b><br>Yeah, I’ve played The Liquid Rooms a few times, actually, it’s a great venue. This tour we’re heading back to a lot of places that I’ve either have done not that recently, or did years ago. I’m heading back to a lot of places that I haven’t been back to for a while.</p><p><b>I’m super excited to see that you’re playing in Findhorn, which is a tiny coastal village not far where I’m from in the North of Scotland! What is it that’s driven you to play some of the more remote parts of the UK this time around?</b><br>I think they’re generally better gigs! I’ve played so many of the larger places so many times, it’s nice to explore a bit more. There’s always a great vibe to a big city gig, but I think you get a deeper connection with the crowd in the smaller venues.</p><p><b>I definitely agree with you on that one. Do you find that you get a bit more of a variation in the type of people that come to your gigs these days? </b><br>I don’t think there could be any more variation in the crowds that come to my gigs! It’s honestly the most diverse group of people that I’ve ever come across. I recently had three generations of a family stay behind for a photo after a gig. The other thing that I hear quite a lot is that my music is often passed around families; I hear that kids have introduced their parents to it or vice versa and then everyone ends up coming to the gig. It’s a beautiful thing.</p><p><b>Your new album, <em>Hit the Ground Running</em> came out on 1st September 2017, which is 10 years since your first album was released. What’s changed for you personally in that time, or in terms of your musical style? </b><br>Well, I just dropped my six-year-old son off at school, if that answers your question! But also, musically… well, the whole game’s changed. The first album was big on MySpace. People were still talking about Bebo! And now it’s obviously completely different. The way that the charts work is different, the way that people experience music has changed. And that’s global. I’ve never had more people ask me about vinyl than on the last European tour.</p><p><b>Do you always release your material on vinyl in addition to the digital copies?</b><br>Yeah. The latest record is independent, it’s my own label. So I was definitely doing vinyl for this one! But when other people are in charge, they sometimes say “Oh, we really don’t need to do vinyl”, and I’m just like, “Come on, man!” But for this one we’ve had some really good vinyl copies. In fact, I signed 500 of them over the last few days.</p><p><b>Are there any particular gigs over the last ten years that have really stood out for you? Where’s your favourite place to play?</b><br>I’m just trying to think… I just really love playing, and I really don’t care where. I almost don’t even care to how many people! I’ve had great gigs in tiny venues in other countries, countries I’ve never been to before - places where I’m just starting out -  and there’s a completely different vibe to that.</p><p><b>From your most recent album, who would you say that your greatest musical influences have been? </b><br>For this one, it was much more soul influenced. Vocally, I was listening to stuff like Donny Hathaway and Chris Stapleton, quite serious vocalists, which is slightly different to usual because I’m usually more of a guitar-nerd than a vocal-nerd. But then I think over the last few years I’ve developed my voice a huge amount, partly through lessons and partly through really exploring it and pushing it on my own. I’ve basically gained an octave and a half of range to play with. Most of this record I couldn’t have sung a few years ago, like ‘Hit the Ground’ - there’s no way I could have got up there! And now the album lends itself to being played live so much more.</p><p><b>I’m a big fan of your cover of ‘Get Free’ by Major Lazer from the <em>Human Love</em> album. Do you have any other songs that you’d like to cover in the future? </b><br>I think covers should be outside of your comfort zone, there’s no point in covering something that you could have written anyway. Actually… I’m not quite sure how this happened, but there was a certain character that at a gig of mine once, kind of Kenneth Williams-esque… for some reason he started rapping, and I started doing a bit of ‘Ante Up’ by M.O.P, in the style of Kenneth Williams… it was completely random, but I kind of like that when an artist goes slightly off piste when they’re live. Everyone knows you’re just making it up as you go along, and as soon as they realise that, everyone’s more engaged and more interested.</p><p><b>You’ve been pretty big on the festival circuit in recent years. Do you have any big ones that you like to play in particular?</b><br>Glastonbury will always be special to me, that was one of the first big festivals that I did. I actually played Bohemian Rhapsody in my pants one year… a weird way to spend an afternoon! A cold, cold experience. But gigwise, when it’s just you on your own, you can react to anything, and every night I’ve been playing songs that I didn’t think I was going to play. It’s a different level of freedom, it’s so much fun. I do a huge amount of crowd participation. What I’ve started doing recently is getting the crowd to do two different parts, then I do a part that harmonizes with half of one and the other half of the other, and every night I’m astonished by what I hear coming back and how it sounds as a whole. It’s just a really beautiful thing, it’s a form of communication. I’m very much from the school of thinking that I’m there on stage to do whatever the crowd wants me to do, as opposed to the idea of “I’m gonna play and you’re gonna listen”. So if the crowd talks, that’s my fault.</p><p><b>Amazing! Okay, one final qu</b><strong>estion from me. I’m going to go a bit Desert Island Discs... If you were stranded on a desert island, what is your one luxury item that you’d take with you, one book and one singular record?</strong><br>Okay… I think my luxury item would definitely have to be a guitar. As long as there’s some coconuts on the island that I can use for percussion. Book-wise… I think I’d take Jonathon Livingston’s Seagull. I read that book once, if not twice, every year anyway. It’s a beautiful book. Very short and easy to read but really beautiful - it reaffirms everything that you already know but which just occasionally might need reconfirming. And a single record… god, that’s so hard! [long pause] I do think Joni Mitchell Blue covers a huge amount of ground. It’s got some funkier tracks and then heartbreakingly beautiful things as well for when you need that.</p><p><b>Thanks so much - looking forward to seeing you in Edinburgh in a few weeks time!</b></p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/14oIZ-TG0L.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The recent trend in British pop music, growing since 2014, is for talented British solo artists to burst into public consciousness as guest vocalists on already established dance / drum’n’bass artist’s singles. Think of Sam Smith (first hitting the charts with Disclosure on Latch), John Newman (similarly with Sigala on Feel the Love) and Anne-Marie (who appeared on four tracks on Rudimental’s 2015 album We The Generation) to name just a few. Having appeared on Chase and Status’ 2016 single ‘All Goes Wrong’, it appears that Tom Grennan will soon be following this newly established route into the music mainstream. As any audience member at Tom Grennan’s sold out show in Glasgow on the 7<sup>th</sup> October will tell you, for the Bedford born singer-songwriter it can’t come soon enough.</p><p>Despite visibly struggling after being “ill as a dog” following a lengthy UK tour schedule, Grennan captivates the packed crowd of St Luke’s Church this Saturday night with his unique vocals, charismatic stage presence and visible excitement for his own music. Kicking off the show with his latest single ‘Royal Highness’ Tom clearly has the crowd on his side from the start. As the set continues, his sense of connection with the audience only increases as his honest, self-deprecating style comes to the fore.</p><p>The tempo of the set is controlled and varies impressively: from the up-beat festival-ready anthems (such as ‘Lighting Matches’ and ‘Giving It All’) to the incredibly honest bluesy Jamie-T style crowd favourite ‘Old Songs’. The audience participates with him in change of pace throughout the performance. Whilst his stripped-back acoustic rendition of ‘Sweet Hallelujah’ leaves the packed auditorium in an uncharacteristic quiet, his stunning vocals cause few to doubt Grennan’s musical pedigree. The quiet doesn’t last for long however. Typical of the entire set; Grennan’s on stage energy instantly lifts the crowd for his hit ‘Found What I’ve Been Looking For’. With the instantly recognisable introduction, from what is currently his most streamed single on Spotify (no doubt fuelled by its recent inclusion in the FIFA ’18 video game and as the theme music for Sky Sports’ Premier League Football coverage), the anthem is belted out by a packed audience</p><p>While ‘Found What I’ve Been Looking For’ might be the most popular single of the evening, what is most impressive is Grennan’s enthusiasm and confidence on stage while remaining incredibly honest and self-deprecating. More established performers may shy away from this, trying to create and maintain a public image. However, Grennan’s unfiltered language, unique voice, quirky observations and admissions throughout the set (such as his confession that he was wearing a stinking shirt) mean that he really does stand out in the crowd.</p><p>Despite the old shirt, in the packed St Luke’s Hall, the only lingering smell was one of a young man, full of ambition and just months away from smashing into the mainstream. If his performance in Glasgow on the 7<sup>th</sup> October is anything to go by, it’s a collision that can’t come too soon.</p><p><b>Grennan’s debut album Lighting Matches is scheduled for release on 9<sup>th</sup> March with a new tour beginning in Bristol on 15<sup>th</sup> March 2018.</b></p><p><b>Setlist: </b>Royal Highness, make ‘em like you, Lighting Matches, Old Songs (acoustic), Lucky Ones, Aboard, Giving It All, Run in the Rain, Barbed Wire, All Goes Wrong, Praying, Sweet Hallelujah (acoustic), Found What I’ve been Looking for, Something in the Water</p>",

      "html": "<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/ICV06iyKEg.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>A night put together by Scruff of the Neck and Fortune saw the Dunfermline band Dancing on Tables headlining at Sneaky Pete’s. Trying to draw a crowd for the gig was a difficult feat with Scotland playing a crucial World Cup qualifier on the same night. However, by the end of the show there was indeed a healthy wee gathering.</p><p>The first act of the night is a young solo artist named Nate Collins. Based in Edinburgh he has been working on several releases and his Soundcloud shows promise. His two latest releases 'Honey’ and ‘Otherwise’ show song writing variety but it seems that during this performance the odds have been stacked against him. With several technical difficulties and slightly unfortunate out of time looping causing problems, he finishes the set with an abrupt ending to a Two Door Cinema Club cover. Although a slightly painful end to his set, I would definitely give him another chance as the talent and promise is quite obviously present.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, the Opera Comic, a Leeds based, Noel Fielding look-alike band take the stage. Starting the set with a strange Willy Wonka cover they continue with what can only be described as pure and persistent indie. Their first single ‘We Are the Freaks’ has that treble guitar sound so emblematic of the genre as well as the ‘no one understands me’ message typical of indie anthems. Although slightly cliché it is definitely a well put-together and skilfully performed song. Their newest release ‘A Time of Hope’ has more depth; ironically disregarding the lack of hope in the world at the moment. The performance is slick and they have full-on stage presence but it seems as if they offer nothing new or different. It will be interesting to see how they develop as a group.</p><p>Now come the headliners of the night: Dancing on Tables are a band on the rise. Firmly established in the young Scottish alternative/indie scene they have been pleasing crowds with their soft, romantic songs all summer. Having played festivals all over the country including Kendal Calling and Solas, their set is a lot more organised and rehearsed than when I saw them last. The interesting use of two vocalists creates a dialogue in their music which is evident in the banter they have on stage. It is obvious that they are simply happy to be playing good music with their friends; and it's incredibly endearing.</p><p>Their debut EP <em>Don’t Stop</em> features fuzzy guitar driven sound punctuated by intricate melody. For a four-track record, the variety in sound is amazing. The slight fuzz which permeates each track, works in their favour and shows the band's simple but lovely core. Their newest release ‘Tracey’ in contrast, is clean cut and one for the dance floor and it goes down a treat during the show. A fantastic band full of promise, they will be releasing some new music at the start of November and I for one am excited.</p>",

After a short period of applause, the musicians immediately started playing on their three guitars while James Yorkston sang the tune. This first song set up an important expectation for the audience: this gig was not about any one of them. All three were on stage the entire time, alternating playing each other’s songs. Using this strategy, Yorkston, Drever, and Wilson created an intimate and engaging show that felt like you were listening in on a jam session between three old friends. The most effective of the songs they played were those sung and performed by all three, replicating a traditional experience of folk music. It felt as if they were playing folk music the way it was meant to be played: informally, communally, and with a good sense of humor. Some of the sincerest and most genuine moments in the show were when they joked to each other about their kids and broke into laughter mid-song.</p><p>The only downfall of their casual performance was that is was occasionally unpracticed to a fault. On one hand, if the show felt too polished, it would not have suited the acoustic music all three of the musicians play. However, they spent a few of the songs laughing throughout about mistakes being made on the guitar or on the mandolin. Although this did take away somewhat from the performance, the overall effect of watching the three talented and experienced musicians jam with each other for a couple of hours was one of familiarity, openness, and warmth.</p>",

The decision to perform completely in darkness should ideally allow the artist’s ego to retreat and the music to take over- but this artistic decision came across as arrogant and a cheap way of appearing profound.</p><p>Set in Summerhall’s Dissection Room, Edinburgh’s own dark ambient duo Super Inuit begin the evening. Their gravelly low bass is punctuated by beams of synth, samples of spoken-word and Fern Morris’ relaxed vocals (her voice occasionally reminiscent of Portishead’s Beth Gibbons’)  which allows the audience to ease into the show. Ambient music is by no means easy-listening, and so Super Inuit serve as a suitable median between the uncomplicated music of everyday life and Tim Hecker’s experimental synth-driven fuzz which we are soon to experience.</p><p>As Hecker arrives onstage, the Dissection Room is plunged into near-total darkness- illuminated only by the blue emergency-exit sign. It remains this way for the rest of his 50 minute set.</p><p>Armed to the teeth with synths and drum pads, Hecker doesn’t play anything that is recognisably his. Since it has been well over a year following the release of his last album Love Streams, it would make sense if he has chosen to show us samples of some new projects. Even if this is the case, it appears as if he is making it up as he goes along. Rolling waves of feedback give way to dense droning bass which resonates in the floor and walls. Wailing peals of synth are interspersed with sporadic gargling sounds and long, drawn out thuds.</p><p>One could argue that ambient music is equally about what you don’t play as what you do- ambience is often formed from the absence of sound itself- and therefore, one might suggest that the decision to perform in a dark space could only serve to amplify the intricacies of the music. By removing the audience’s reliance on seeing in order to be entertained, Hecker forces them to focus on his experimental ambient and drone music that engulfs the room. This vision-depravation however also allows the audience to focus on the uncomfortable feeling of standing for a prolonged period of time and the familiar glow of phone screens indicate that after a while, some become restless.</p><p>Tim Hecker has said that he enjoys <a href=\"http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/tim-hecker-virgins\">“inhabiting the tropes of religious music without that promise of angels at the end”</a> and fans have in the past compared attending his performances to having a religious or spiritual experience. Hecker’s performance did indeed remind me of being in church as a child- but not for the grandeur of the music. Instead I listened, wondering for how long I would be required to stand while internally hoping it would be over soon. I would hardly call that a religious experience.</p>",

Sit down. How’s things?’ And so it begins. A dark, absurdist and brutal comedy that descends into a disturbingly realistic prophecy of a corporate life.</p><p>Emma, an employee at a big multinational, is bound to a contract whereby she must not leave any aspect of her private life undeclared in order to keep her job. This could be an ideal foundation for humour. The disparity over what Emma and Darren, her love interest, define as ‘romantic’ is amusing, and the audience settles nicely into the comedy.</p><p>But for the boss, the presence of a candle at the employee’s ‘romantic’ dinner is a matter of protocol, and needs to be resolved. The relentless probing has begun. The professional-personal boundary is obliterated. The boss tries an awkward human gesture, professing occasionally, ‘oh, just small talk’, but really, Emma’s every utterance is being detailed and filed. The veneer of interest and care barely masks the obsessive and inhumane quest for answers; the term ‘care’ is only familiar to her because of the company’s ‘duty of care’ pamphlet that she can produce at a flourish at any sign of emotion on Emma’s part.</p><p>The set design of the simplistic office reflects the corporate environment. The nameless boss is on stage as the audience enters the auditorium, and does not leave until we do, fitting for a character with an obsessive commitment to her job and lack of a more human existence outside of the workplace. Even between scene changes, she doesn’t leave her office den of manipulation and heartlessness, continuing to pace and do paperwork as a blue sterile light floods the stage. Perhaps the fact that the clock wasn’t working was not intended, but it did serve to emphasise the obsessive, repetitive questions and heighten the intensity of the play.</p><p>Thus the play swerves from comedy to sinister realism and it makes for uncomfortable viewing, which Mark Bartlett, author of the play, has mastered elsewhere, in his BBC drama, Doctor Foster. We’re forced to keep watching, just as Emma is repeatedly summoned to the office, but we’re begging for some kind of dénouement, to put an end to this tortuous episode. But there’s more, and as Emma brings a shoe box supposedly containing her dead son onto the stage, the audience is paralysed between laugher and distress in the climax to this piece of dark absurdist theatre. It’s a relief to see the actresses step out of the office and smile, and to escape the nightmare we’ve just endured with them.</p>",

Just over a year ago, he finally signed to a major label, Island Records. He released his mixtape, <em>Sixteen</em>, in June to celebrate this shift in his career. Last week Rebecca Somer and Robbie James got to chat with him backstage at the O2 Academy Glasgow about his new project and growth as an artist.</p><p><strong>Robbie James: “You’re supporting Dizzee Rascal on his Raskit Tour, which started last night in Liverpool. I had a few friends at the concert, so I saw it on Snapchat. It looked mad! How was the first night of the tour?”</strong></p><p>Donae’O: “It was tremendous. It was a good start. I didn’t know what to expect. I had never really done concerts before. I’ve only done one, which was mine. Never really been on tour, and Dizzee Rascal, he’s one of, if not the, biggest in our scene. Sometimes you feel there’s a bit of pressure, but yeah, it was cool.”</p><p><strong>Rebecca Somer: “How did <em>Sixteen</em> come about?”</strong></p><p>Donae’O: “I signed to Island [Records] in December, put out 'Black' and 'Black' did well. I was like, ‘We need to put out a project now.’ They were like ‘No, we think you need to build the buzz’, and I was like ‘Ok, cool, let me just make a mixtape, and put it out, so I thought let me just do <em>Sixteen</em>.’ It’s a new experience. They let me hire out a studio, which I’m not really used to doing. I’m used to recording in my mum’s house, in my bedroom in the corner. I thought ‘let me just try something new’, so I made it in three months. Usually, I make my albums in a year or year and a half. This was compressed, but it was a good experience. Now, I’m ready. I can see now that when you’re making records, sometimes you have to be in the moment, and that’s what <em>Sixteen</em> taught me- that I can be in the moment and that I can make a project there and then.”</p><p><strong>Robbie: “I've always wondered to what extent the songwriting process is a case of saying 'Right, this evening I'm gonna go write a song', versus a more natural process that comes about while travelling?”</strong></p><p>Donae’O: “I think it’s a bit of both. I think you should be proactive in trying and then sometimes it may not come up unless you’ve tried. Sometimes when you have a hit, you need to just go and make the album. You need to constantly feed your fans. You know what I’m saying?”</p><p><strong>Rebecca: “What was your favourite track on <em>Sixteen</em>?”</strong></p><p>Donae’O: “I don’t really do the whole favourite track thing. All of my songs I like equally. That is why I’ve never ever had a favourite record. The only thing I will say is my favourite to do is when I’m performing, I like performing ‘Move to Da Gyal Dem’ most because people respond to that the most. People dance to it the most. It’s just a fun track to put on.”</p><p><strong>Rebecca: “How do you hope for people to respond to your music?”</strong></p><p>Donae’O: “I hope they enjoy it really. That’s it. I hope they enjoy it as much as I enjoy it.”</p><p><strong>Rebecca: “Can you talk a little about how you’ve evolved as a musician from your early days when you dropped your first singles ‘Falling’ &amp; ‘My Philosophy (Bounce)’ to today?”</strong></p><p>Donae’O: “I think when I was coming in I didn’t really know what I was doing. And now, I know a bit more. I still don’t know what I’m doing, but I know a bit more than I did then. I know that I will always make my way through. I remember how I was feeling back then. When you put out your first record, you don’t know if you’re ever going to do it again. Whereas now I don’t feel like that. I always feel like I’ll eventually make something, so I have way more confidence in my abilities than I did then.”</p><p><strong>Rebecca: “What’s the greatest lesson you’ve learned from being in the industry for so long?”</strong></p><p>Donae’O: “Always be able to stand on your own two. You’re always going to need help, but it’s better to be an individual than a team, meaning you should be confident in your own skills because when you join a team, it’s your skills that you bring to the table, and you need to find a team that respects that and don’t want you to be everyone else. You have to find your own way.”</p><p><strong>Robbie: “I read an interview of you in TRENCH recently, and it asked you to describe your career and journey through music with one word. You said ‘independence.’ Where does that independence and self-sufficiency stem from?”</strong></p><p>Donae’O: “That was a necessity when I started because we didn’t have platforms, and I wanted to make music, so I had to work it out for myself. I had a massive need and passion to make music and no platform to express that passion, so I had to create my own platform.”</p><p><strong>Rebecca: “What music or artists inspire you right now?”</strong></p><p>Donae’O: “Lotto Boyzz, Kojo Funds, J Hus, Skepta, Don-E. I’m listening to a lot of Afro-wave. That’s what they call it now.”</p><p><strong>Rebecca: “What should we look forward to in your upcoming studio album?”</strong></p><p>Donae’O: “I don’t know yet. I’m still promoting <em>Sixteen</em>.”</p><p><strong>Robbie: “You’ve recently released a new video for ‘Let Me’ featuring Young T, Bugsey and Belly Squad. How’s the reaction been for that? Have you been excited?”</strong></p><p>Donae’O: “Yeah, it’s been really good to be honest. This is the third video we’ve done from that mixtape. The response has been tremendous, so I’m really happy about that.”</p><p><strong>Robbie: “You have got a few exciting things coming up. I saw that you’ll be at BBC1 Radio Extra Live on the 11th of October in Manchester with J Hus, Bryson Tiller, Stefflon Don, etc. That’s pretty exciting, right?”</strong></p><p>Donae’O: “Yes, very exciting. I’m looking forward to it. They always support my music. It’s great that I can give back.”</p><p><strong>Robbie: “I must ask you one more thing before you go. Are you a fan of the video done by Big Shaq, the comedy creation of Michael Dapaah of ‘Man’s Not Hot’ on BBC Radio 1Xtra?”</strong></p><p>Donae’O: “I’m a massive fan of what he does. I think it’s amazing how he created a T.V. series on Youtube off of these five characters, and Shaq was one of them, and like Shaq’s journey from being a criminal to going the righteous path. Again, 1Xtra supported him in that journey because he’s an actor, a comedy actor, but they supported it, and it’s helped him get that deal. I think people should look at how he created his own way and created something that was entertaining. He went all the way with it and done it to the best of his ability. The fact that 'Man’s Not Hot' is charting. I hope he takes it into movies, and he’s talented in that way. Clearly, he’s ambitious that way and very focused, so I wish the best for him.”</p><p>Listen to the full interview with Donae’O on Friday’s Music Team HUB Show at 3pm.</p>",

With the aid of a projector, Marcus begins the show in Spanish whilst donning the persona of an energetic Spaniard - a quirk that works very well. He then slips into his next character; a stereotype of a hippie-esque backpacker who claims to \"be on a journey\".</p><p>Throughout the next hour, Marcus continues to provide us with observational humour and wild tales from his adventures in Latin America. His spontaneity and ability to command the audience prove that he is a born-performer.</p><p>The show comes to an end with a rather poignant message, that in order to be comfortable in life you have to accept and be happy with yourself. But then of course, in true Marcus Ryan style, the message is flipped on its head; revealing a hilarious punch line and leaving the audience in hysterics.</p><p>'¿Hablas Inglés?' contains adult humour, character comedy and very relatable laughs. A must-see for anyone who enjoys witty banter and has travelled to another country at least once in their lives. You can catch '¿Hablas Inglés?' at 5pm at The Three Sisters.</p>",

This show is not so much a stand-up show, but more Auton’s treatise on hair, and how our hair is a symbol of life, and its passing.</p><p>Auton monologues about hair for the hour with a largely modest prose, occasionally breaking into verse or lyrical passages. Auton uses verse with restrain, but these passing moments show a rare sense for sentiment and rhythm, the verse tripping off his tongue extremely naturally. Auton begins unassumingly, or at least as unassumingly as a man in a hair-covered suit can. He gradually draws the audience into his inner world, pulling them in with his charming dramatic voice and endearingly awkward movement on stage. The show is unusual, yet comforting. Auton explores the quiet absurdity of ordinary life with gentle humour and optimism.</p><p>While the show is difficult to categorise, Auton is a good choice for any fans of spoken word, poetry readings, or anyone looking for an escape from stand-up comedy.</p>",

Roberts speaks for much of the show in a cod-chaucerian dialect, which he prods the audience into adopting. He arrives on stage loosely wrapped in a towel, a flower poking out of his backside. The show is based on the premise that John-Luke Roberts is actually Chaucer, awoken after a Tir Nan nOg-like slumber, because John-Luke Roberts wants the show to be “significant”. The show sadly rarely deals with this premise, but doesn’t waste time, catapulting itself from one absurd premise to the next.</p><p>Roberts rarely lets an opportunity pass by him, even turning costume changes into a joke. Audience members are asked to cover him up with a towel, which shrinks as the show continues. The technician is roped in to awkwardly provide a voiceover while Roberts is performing a major costume change backstage. This all makes the show seem like a continual parade of absurdity, which feels exciting, rather than overwhelming.</p><p>John-Luke Roberts’ show is an absurd hour filled with fantastic ideas, perfect for fans of The Goons, Big Train, or The Mighty Boosh. Don’t go if you aren’t comfortable with nudity.</p>",

Donnelly’s laid-back conversational style is gentle and unassuming, and the venue definitely helps build the feeling he seems to be aiming for. The small confines lend themselves to Donnelly’s moderate tones, drawing you into a show that is more about the internal world than the external.</p><p>For a show about hallucinogens and the mystical, Donnelly’s style is suitably dream-like and measured. You’re never quite sure if you should be expecting a punchline or tender moment. The show swings from emotional truths to the profane and scatological in a beat, keeping you a little off balance, despite Donnelly’s affability. His occasional musings on his mental state are endearing, and emotionally resonant. However, there are still  echoes of his previous, man-down-the-pub style to him.</p><p>Donnelly’s brought his stand-up skills to bear on stories that have real heart to them. He deals with genuinely difficult topics with humour. He also avoids being flippant with these topics, which would be difficult task for anyone. Donnelly has definitely brought one of the more unassumingly powerful shows on the fringe this year.</p>",

Andrew O’Neill enters the show wearing bare chested, demon horns curving upwards from his head, a censer swinging from his hand as he strides through the audience, slowly chanting a spell. The spell is addressed to Mercury, the Roman god of poetry, luck, and a divine guide for souls. O’Neill, after his appearance, explains that the spell was not entirely an act, and that he has performed it previously in a genuine ritual. All I can say is that if he wanted to improve his performance skills and give himself guidance, it’s worked.</p><p>O’Neill’s performance style is confrontational, loud, and brutally funny. “Brutally funny” because there isn’t a better way I can phrase it. He is funny at you, not to you. You’re not entirely sure what’s happening, you don’t know why you’re laughing this much, and you’re not entirely sure why he’s yelling. O’Neill commands your attention with wide-eyed mania, yelling out non-sequiturs that are later brought into the fold of a joke. He performs with a manner reminiscent of the metal bands whose names run down his jeans. His vocal delivery puts raw energy through you, so you cannot help but give him your attention.</p><p>While I would recommend earplugs to prevent tinnitus, O’Neill should be on your list for this year. His show is nothing short of, well, magick. It is a loud display of energy backed by a clear idea, a rare case at the Fringe</p>",

Braine slips in and out of character as an art history professor, occasionally playing parody songs about artists and the art world. The show is slow and meandering, but her charm holds her audience. While the pace of her show may be too listless for some, her wry sense of humour is woven into her songs well, and her stage persona is well-conceived and genuinely funny.</p><p>Unfortunately, Braine does not use this persona to the fullest. We only get snatches of the professor character, which I would have preferred to see developed further. The songs themselves are performed with style and pleasant to listen to, but some could have used more gags. The show feels a little aimless at times, although this may be due to Braine’s character being aimless, not Braine herself. In all, the show has a few small flaws for some, but may be more appealing to gentler tastes.</p><p>I feel that the show is a good choice for anyone who needs to relax (or feels hungover) at lunchtime. Harriet Braine's debut definitely is an enjoyable hour, and I hope we see her return to the fringe.</p>",

The start of the show goes as absurdly as you would expect from the title and the poster; Falafel goes on stage playing a Toilet Duck as a saxophone, “performing” a deliberately awful version of Gerry Rafferty’s Baker Street. The show has great bursts of creativity throughout it, and I'm a sucker for absurdist comedy, so I love it. It's a show that weaves in and out of genres, whether it’s prop comedy, musical comedy, or stand-up. After 20 minutes, it unfortunately became clear that much of Falafel’s act is relatively standard observational comedy, which doesn't sit well with the rest of his act.</p><p>Falafel’s style does distinguish itself when he is doing observersational material, however. The first half-hour is an interwoven series of callbacks to set-ups that had been dropped minutes before. Non-sequiturs are shown to have been set-ups to punch-lines delivered 10 minutes later. Although some of his jokes seem like they could have been part of Tommy Cooper's act, this retro feel seems strangely fitting for Olaf Falafel. However, some of his jokes do seem like they were written to be absurd, rather than funny.</p><p>However, Falafel’s actual content is sadly a little lack-lustre, and the topics themselves are somewhat well-trodden. For a comedian with such an off-beat style, his content does seem too pedestrian for him. The show itself did seem to be lacking more absurdity as it went on. The climax of the show is also a nice payoff, but the impact is lessened considerably by the overlong preparation for it. This is a problem that much of Falafel's material suffers from, and I would like to see less time wasted between the set up and the punchline.</p><p>Falafel still shows signs of real promise. His prop comedy, crowd-work, and use of multimedia add a lot to the show, and there is a lot of charm to his more old-fashioned jokes. I hope we see more of him in the future, and that he gets a lot stranger.</p>",

He moves from impassioned rants to slow, difficult silence suddenly, and then will turn to you with a knowing look in his eye. This is what makes it all work; little acknowledgements of humility that bring Shah’s audience round to him. Shah could very much be an unlikeable figure, and he could have been, in another life, a more aggressive, adversarial comic. In this show, Shah uses these moments of vulnerability to help deliver a surprisingly powerful show on Brexit and the rise of the far-right in the UK.</p><p>Shah focuses his show around the role of history in the political life of the UK, and in his personal life. T the role of the British Empire in the story of his family takes a central position in the show, ridiculing the ignorance that many British people have about this part of their history. If you’d like to see one of the sharpest shows on today’s political tides, Ahir Shah is a smart choice.</p>",

Martin’s new show is definitely carried by her distinctive voice, fizzing with energy yet uncertain, enthusiastic to get to the point, yet not sure where that point is. Her bittersweet show is peppered with absurd asides, and although this can make the show feel almost flippant, Martin still manages to drive the emotional impact home. On top of this balancing act, she doesn’t sacrifice the high-energy mood that she usually brings to her shows; impressive considering the show is about her struggle with addiction.</p><p>Martin’s show ends with a narrative ambiguity that is oddly fitting for the arc of the show, and her finish is one of the most memorable I’ve seen in ages. Her scattergun energy gave her routines a force that is hard to find elsewhere. A freewheeling hour is brought to a close with a routine that ratchets up faster than I could register, and despite some loose ends, the ending feels oddly satisfying. Martin’s show would be a great choice for anyone looking for mile-a-minute narrative stand-up, or perhaps something with a more optimistic outlook.</p>",

It swings wildly from one topic to another; one minute, the voice of Bernie Sanders is sputtering out his hunched figure, the next, he off-handedly veers into a pitch for a filthy Netflix show. The hour is more a loose series of vignettes than a finely honed, thematically focused piece, and the show feels a little disconnected at times. This approach more than fits Adomian’s conversational, scatter-brained style, which is pretty damn charming.</p><p>While there isn’t a message or lesson to mull over afterwards as in other stand-up shows, Adomian gives you unrestrained comedic talent. If you want to see a man suddenly become possessed by the spirit of Jesse Ventura or Paul Giamatti, go see this show. If you want to watch someone switch topics from Wii and weight anxiety to Stalin and marijuana, go see this show. If smart if unfocused comedy sounds like your thing, you couldn’t go far wrong with James Adomian.</p>",

In it Josef K. is arrested in his bedroom by two men on his 30th birthday without being given a reason. For a year he tries to fight the court and proof his innocence. This seems to be impossible as he encounters weird characters on his way who ultimately drive him into complete surrender. Kafka’s gloomy story was perfectly displayed in the melancholy stage setting which just like the pale actors and their costumes lacked any colour and presented a dreary, grey atmosphere. While the music and the songs are not worth mentioning as they were rather monotonous, the excellent acting performance rounded up a successful and entertaining production that is definitely worth watching.</p>",

      "html": "<p>When the ambient, shoegaze pop band of four arrived on stage at King Tut’s they were bathed in a pale blue light, appropriate for the sad, melancholy vibe that one should expect from a Cigarettes After Sex gig. Despite being an intimate venue, with the stage only a metre or so above audience level, King Tut’s has hosted many notable acts on their paths to musical fame; the recent ‘Supersonic’ documentary reveals that it was at this particular venue that Oasis was discovered and signed to Creation records. On the stairs up to the gig venue one can see a seemingly endless chronological list of incredible bands and artists who have taken to the stage. (My personal favourites include Blur, Elastica and The Strokes).</p><p>Cigarettes After Sex open their set with a slow, dreamy rendition of ‘Starry Eyes’ from the band’s first EP. Lead singer Greg Gonzalez’s vocals drone over relaxing bass lines and delicate drum rhythms conveying a sense of tenderness and emotional sincerity. The band also perform single they had released just the week before, called ‘K’, and an unreleased track ‘Sunset’. In an interview with KA Radio Scotland, Gonzalez describes drawing influence from the electronic sound of New Order and the introspective lyrics of The Smiths. For several audience members, seeing Cigarettes After Sex perform live was an emotionally intense experience - some even left the show with tears streaming from their eyes as the band closed with ‘Nothing’s Gonna Hurt You Baby’. Despite not visiting Edinburgh on this world tour, Cigarettes After Sex will be back to perform at The Caves next April.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/dLLG6qZx.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure>",

It’s been three years since the last one – what have you been up to?</strong></p><p>We were kind of touring for the last year and a half or so and then yeah we jumped in, we rented our studio and started working on new songs but at the same time we were still playing quite a lot of European festivals. Then we went straight to New York and after that was like about a year down the line and working on the record and going a bit mental! And yeah then we recorded the record and pretty much went straight back into a rehearsal space.</p><p><strong>So I see right now you’re touring Europe and then you’ve got some stuff in the UK and then it looks like you’re back off to the US?</strong></p><p>Yeah and that kind of brings us to December and then we’ll probably take a bit of a break.</p><p><strong>It sounds well deserved! So how do you find the different countries compare in terms of touring- is the audience pretty similar everywhere or are there different vibes?</strong></p><p>Um there’s definitely different vibes country to country. I think it has a lot to do with the culture of every country and how they behave in everyday life. Like generally down south in Europe it’s pretty very warm kind of crowds and really happy to be there. Then up in the UK it’s like a little bit…little bit quieter, but it also depends on what day of the week it is. If it’s the weekend people are generally a lot rowdier and up for it. I think it also has to do with like whether people are into like going to gigs that much. Obviously like in London people just are so used to have everything so available that there’s like a little bit more of an “Impress Me” kind of attitude.</p><p><strong>Is there any area you’ve not been yet that you’ve got your eye on?</strong> Definitely South America – that’s something we’re very keen on going to at some point. We’ve never been as people or as a band so that would be really nice. It’s nice going back to places too to get to discover more than just a snapshot. Canada is lovely, so is Australia and Japan.</p><p><strong>We’re looking forwards to seeing you in Scotland soon – how do you find it?</strong></p><p>Yeah it’s always been so nice there. I think like it’s such a lovely bunch of people and they tend to be quite quiet. We’ve played Glasgow quite a lot between our own shows and opening for other bands. Our guitar tech lives in Glasgow and we’ve worked with many Scottish people along the way so it’s always really nice to come back.</p><p><strong>You’ve got Wilsen as your opening act, how is that going?</strong> She’s someone that we’ve known for quite a while now and she’s opened for us in the UK quite a few times already. She makes beautiful music that has such a special, intimate thing about it. Her new album is amazing and it’s such an honour to have her with us.</p><p><strong>So going back to the new album – how does the writing process work?</strong></p><p>It’s very much Elena doing the lyrics. I personally focus very much on the music. I have conversations about the lyrics because of my role as a producer but it’s very much a thing that is hers. What is interesting for us as musicians was that Elena was being a lot more direct with her lyrics so then it was like how do you support that in a musical way just because before it was always kind of stranded approach. It was more about being evocative with the music, but this time around it was more just about entering into the lyrics and translating directly what she was saying.</p><p><strong>Do you have any favourites on the album?</strong></p><p>They all have a special place but I think Mothers was one that took a really long time to get to where it is so I have a special bit of my heart for that one.</p><p><strong>The video for No Care has a really interesting effect with all of the different shots and lighting. What was the process of making it like?</strong></p><p>We just knew we wanted something that was quite fast paced and frenetic but then after that we just kind of let Jamie (the director) do his thing. So much of it has to do with the editing up until the point of getting the first edit we didn’t actually know what it was going to look like. We obviously said sort of what we wanted it to look like but that was kind of a surprise but it turned out great. We were very happy.</p><p><strong>What’s the story behind the album art?</strong></p><p>The artist is someone from Brighton, Sarah Shaw. My girlfriend introduced me to her art and there were a few paintings I fell in love with but that one stayed my favourite. I kept it to myself for quite a while but eventually I told the guys that I was thinking it could be the artwork.</p><p><strong>I hear everything from indie-folk, electronic, even shoegazing being used to describe Daughter’s genre. How would you classify Daughter as a band?</strong></p><p>I have a hard time classifying it. I quite like that different words are being turned around, it’s not maybe necessarily just like a typical one being used across the board. But for me the way I try to say it is a huge focus on song and on texture and atmosphere. We make sure there’s a really interesting world you can delve into with each song.</p><p><strong>How does Daughter’s complex sound translate to live performances and different venues?</strong></p><p>I think venue space has been important particularly with the first record, but the second one I think that it’s a little bit more straightforward in terms of sound so we’re actually playing academies which we used to avoid like the plague. Now it feels like in the state that we are with our sound we may be a bit less dependent on a venue. If anything we want something that’s a little bit tighter due to the faster rhythm stuff that we’re doing.</p><p><strong>You’ve been playing a lot of festivals recently – is there a big difference?</strong></p><p>Yeah there is and at the very start we were found playing festivals a bit weird but we’ve got our own little space now. We’re careful about what places we play but we really love it. There’s such an element of surprise, a bit less pressure so it’s a lot of fun. And also with the new songs again it’s been really fun.</p><p><strong>Daughter hasn’t really done any collaborations before – can you see that happening in the future?</strong></p><p>Yeah we’d love to do it but I think we’re just a bit shy. It’s not something where we can necessarily have a natural thing with lots of people getting involved, but it’s definitely something we’d like to do in the future.</p><p><strong>Who would be your dream artist to collaborate with?</strong></p><p>I’ve been a huge admirer of Bjork for a long time. She’s been a really big influence to the way I think and play music but there are so many people! I like quite a lot of electronic music too so maybe someone there.</p><p><strong>What advice would you give to people thinking of starting their own band?</strong></p><p>It’s such an individual thing that I have a hard time giving advice. I think probably the best advice I could give is to make sure to do what feels right to the individuals that are part of the project. You can’t let yourself get misguided at any point. At the end of the day it’s you that bears the consequences of your actions so you need to be happy and comfortable with what you do.</p><p><strong>And finally, what’s coming next for Daughter?</strong></p><p>It’s definitely something we need to figure out but I think we need to take a bit of time off first. We’ll start thinking about it and collecting individual ideas, so then we can see which way the wind blows.</p><p><strong>Thank you and looking forward to seeing you play Glasgow!</strong></p>",

      "html": "<p><br><b>Hey Girlpool! This is your first time playing in the U.K, how are the shows going so far?</b></p><p>Cleo: We’ve played one show in Brighton last night. It was super fun.</p><p>Harmony: It was really fun, it was the first time we’ve ever gotten an encore, it was really weird.</p><p>C: It was so funny we played almost all of our songs, we don’t have a ton of songs.</p><p>H: Yeah it was really cool. It was really trippy, it’s our first show here and we didn’t know what to expect and it was so cool, it was awesome.</p><p><b>How and why did you two decide to start Girlpool?</b></p><p>C: Harmony and I were going to shows at this space called The Smell in Los Angeles really often. We played in two different bands and overlapped and played similar shows. I left my band and we started playing together. We decided to start something where we could wrote songs that are very honest rather than just creating for others to lo like. We wanted to start a project that had a specific intention of being honest.</p><p>H: I think we just wanted a lot of sincerity.</p><p><b>Your lyrical honesty and frankness is something that’s really refreshing, especially in guitar music where this is often shied away from. Why do you think this is?</b></p><p>H: I think there’s a lot of culture around being cool and that can be a part of it.</p><p>C: I feel like people always say it’s a strange time for music because of what’s happening right now. Like what’s the wave, what’s the scene?. Everyone’s in this niche and finding their own groove to ride. I feel like for very popular bands right now, cool is something that’s important.</p><p>H: Yeah, it’s difficult how much music culture interacts with image culture as an artist. Because of that image bypasses what the music is and it becomes a much bigger monster than it is.</p><p>C: Especially in Los Angeles.</p><p>H: It can be really disappointing and distressing and uncomfortable. I think image has the most to do with it.</p><p><br><b>You’re often described as a ‘feminist band’, do you take any grievance with being put in one category at all?</b></p><p>C: Yeah. Being labeled as one specific thing, regardless, can be frustrating. Both of us have struggled with that. There’s a few songs on the E.P that talk about gender and stuff, so we are doing other things and moving onwards. It’s frustrating to be labelled as one thing when your entire being is a million different things.</p><p>H: it’s also lke when you’re creating you don’t have an agenda or are propagandising, you’re just doing your thing honestly. When people take what you do honestly and make an expectation of you, that’s unfair to the rest of your honest being.</p><p><b>This year people are becomming more and more vocal about gross sexism in alternative music. Have you ever experienced this in the way that people treat you at gigs or how journalists write about you (e.g The Guardian’s description of you as ‘shrieking’).</b></p><p>C: We haven’t experienced that a whole lot, just a few times. I always say I wasn’t made aware of my gender until I started a band. It’s only happened in some articles, like The Guardian one and being called a girl band is always aggravating.</p><p>H: Sound people do it the most.</p><p>C: It’s not something that makes us want to write songs about it more. It’s just like, ok stop it go away.</p><p><b>Do you think that there’s any way we can change this culture around women in music, as artists, writers and fans?</b></p><p>H: Yeah, just forget that it’s women in music, it’s human beings in music. Whatever you identify as, it shouldn’t affect what your creation is seen as and I think that that goes for all types of art.</p><p>C: It’s frustrating to be called a girl playing music, or girl punk.</p><p>H: We’re just people doing our stuff.</p><p><b>So your E.P is out right now in the U.K and it is excellent but what’s next?</b></p><p>C: YES!! We’re ready for it, bring it on! We’re coming out with an album in spring, we’ve been writing and writing and writing and are super exciting to share it with everyone. There will definitely be more uk and eurpean tours!</p><p><b>Finally, we’d like to know who you think that we should be listening to from L.A or the States?</b></p><p>Simultaneously: Radiator Hospital</p><p>H: Alex G, Quarterbacks</p><p>C: Steven Steinbrink, Told Slant, Frankie Cosmos</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/mn6N2qMfu.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure>",

      "html": "<p>So the answer is “No Thanks” to an Independent Scotland. And in the end it was a fairly clear No, maybe not as clear as some would have liked but certainly clearer than many expected. Although many of the votes ran pretty close there were only four local government areas out of thirty-two (Glasgow, Dundee, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire) where the Yes campaign won and there were plenty of corresponding No areas that won by a clear margin, our own Edinburgh being a fine example. The final result showed a 10% margin in favour of No, a far bigger gap than many of the pollsters were predicting in the days running up to the vote and in the end the final result was known well in advance of the last count (from the tardy Highlands) being announced.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/QNDFw9y-T.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>So that’s the end of the matter you might think. Oh, how wrong you would be! Whichever way the vote had gone the referendum was always going to send shockwaves through the political life of the British Isles. Already the big names of British politics are buckling down to weather the storm and wisely so, it’s going to be no plain sailing.</p><p>Although the No vote may have saved the nation from political power plays over the likes of the currency, Trident, the NHS and even the Queen; there are still plenty of issues waiting to rock the boat. First and foremost is the thorny matter of greater devolution in favour of the Scottish Parliament, within the framework of the United Kingdoms. Devo-max, as politics nerds love to call it, would likely increase the scope of the Scottish parliament’s authority over tax revenue and housing funds but to exactly what extent has still to be decided, as has the timeframe for the changes. Expect complaints of Westminster stalling from Holyrood and accusations of obstinacy flying the other way as the leaders of the two nations haggle over the extend of Scotland’s control over her own spending and taxation.</p><p>In the opposite direction the prospect of Scotland leaving the Union for fresher tides has stirred up discontent in England over the deficiencies of the current political system. Just as in Scotland, many south of the boarder feel alienated from Westminster and disenchanted with its politicians. The Scottish Referendum has shown them that they don’t have to except the status quo and many are calling for changes to be made. Particularly contentious has been the so called Midlothian Question. The issue of whether or not Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish MPs should have the right to vote in the House of Commons on issues concerning English Health, Education or Transport when English MPs have no such rights in the Parliaments of the other nations is contentious one. Questions had been raised even before today about the possibility of an English Parliament to match the likes of Holyrood or Stormont and now that the votes are in the calls have not stopped. MPs across England have stated their desire for either the establishment of an English Parliament or the banning of MPs from other nations taking part in votes that exclusively affect England. Either way David Cameron is going to have his hands full calming the demands of MPs, media outlets and voters alike and has already acknowledged that the people of all the nations within the Union must have a bigger say over their own affairs. But let’s be honest, in the run up to a General Election it’s the last thing he, or his Party, needs.</p><p>Another question raised by the events of the Referendum campaign, and one that affects the whole of the UK, is the issue of the voting age. Alex Salmond caused a lot of controversy when he declared two years ago that the voting age for the Referendum would be lowered from the usual 18, to 16. Cue arguments that 16 year olds aren’t worldly enough to vote, that they aren’t engaged enough in politics to use their vote wisely, that they’ll be too easily swayed by the opinions of their parents or their friends, I could go on. But now, in the calm after the storm, many are praising the involvement of Scotland’s youth in the debate. Scotland has proved that many young people are interested in politics and that they can engage as fully as their older counterparts in running of their country. So should they be allowed the vote again in future? It’s a question many are asking with an eye to next year’s general election and it’s one that many will be waiting to hear the answer to with bated breath, not least the 16 and 17 year olds who have had their first taste of the democratic system and keen for more. Moreover, with the turnout at the polls averaging at 84% in this vote, levels only dreamed of for General Elections, many are asking how the rest UK can become more engaged in politics and many are pointing to the youth vote as the answer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://content.freshair.org.uk/content/images/gS2xKhz5B.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>So even though Scotland has said No to Independence, that doesn’t mean it’s a No to change. The leaders of all the major Parties have pledge that things will not remain the same in Scotland, or in the rest of the UK, after the ballot boxes, campaign posters and bunting have been cleared away. One thing is for sure, with Alex Salmond stepping down from the leadership of the Scottish government and the SNP, the face of Scottish politics is going to be very different going forward, both metaphorically and literally, as the good ship HMS Scotland sails off into the future.</p>",

This doesn’t seem to have held him back though, as we are reminded of in Hawking: a biography of the physicist’s life, told in his own words.</p><p>We are all aware that Stephen Hawking is an extra-ordinary man, having lived with amyloid lateral sclerosis (ALS) for almost 50 years and concurrently become a world-renowned researcher, teacher and writer; but Hawking takes us further than a list of achievements, and allows us access to Stephen Hawking the child, man, student, friend and husband.</p><p>The film generally moves chronologically through Hawking’s life, with interviews from siblings, colleagues and friends, occasionally moving gently back to the present to show Hawking’s day-to-day life at Cambridge and home. Stories from Hawking’s childhood move on to give us insight into Hawking’s early years at Oxford, when partying, dancing and coxing seemed to take up most of his time; and then onwards to meeting his first wife and the onset of the disease which would change his life forever.</p><p>The dramatic effects of ALS are discussed honestly, with Hawking and his family being understandably devastated, however the film is not overly morbid or emotional, much as the human response to harsh life events often isn’t. The film is also brave in that it doesn’t hero-worship Hawking, there are open accounts from his first wife about the breakdown of their marriage and the difficulty of living with a genius. It is also interesting to hear how much joy Hawking seems to draw from his current celebrity status, clearly proud to be on talk-shows and make cameos in The Simpson’s and Star Trek.</p><p>All-in-all Hawking is a sincere, truthful and interesting film about a man who is fascinating in so many ways, and ordinary in so many others.</p><p><em>Helen saw Hawking as part of Edinburgh International Film Festival 2013</em></p>",
